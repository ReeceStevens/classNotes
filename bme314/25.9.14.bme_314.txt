Endovascular Stents
===================
Stent design is complex, requires multidisciplinary approach
	Blood vessel anatomy
		endothelial layer, vascular smooth muscle cells (do expansion/contraction work), adventitia
	Atherosclerosis	
		buildup of plaque in arteries
		eschemea- lack of blood flow
		consequences
			coronary heart disease
			one person dies from CHD every minute
	Clinical use of stents
		inserted through femoral artery 
		deploy balloon to open up vessel
		balloon angioplasty (no stent used)-- rapid inflation/deflation of balloon
	$7.4 billion spent on stents
	900,000 people get coronary stents each year
	Stent Design
		Radially stiff to keep artery open
		flexible to follow the path of the artery
		minimize material to lower biological impact
		coil/helix
			flexiblity-good, radial stiffness: poor
		slotted tube
			flexibilty- poor, radial stiffness: excellent
		wire mesh
			flexibility-good, radial stiffness: good;
		Considerations
			high elastic modulus
			low yield strength
			fatigue resistance
			biocompatible, radiopaque
		metal usage
			cobalt chromium vs stainless steel
			cobalt 45% stronger -> thinner struts
	Limitations
		in stent restenosis
			reocclusion of the arterial lumen
			25% occurance
	Drug eluting stents
		polymer coating on stents allows delivery of chemotherapy drugs
		reduced restenosis from 20-30% tp 10%
