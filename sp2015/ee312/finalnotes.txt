Notes for the final exam
========================

---- Exam 1 portion ----
4 programming questions, 5 pts each (could contain hash table stuff, i.e. SCANNING A HASH TABLE)
    time complexity of soln, etc.
Output of programs (parameter passing, stack, array parameters, references)
no integer overflow qs or anything like that, but KNOW 2s COMPLEMENT
no specific qs on pointers, just throughout the exam
Big-Oh, stack frame diagrams
Knuth heap layout, algorithm (4pts)
---- Exam 2 portion ----
Wall of text question, hash table is expected
Identifying good hash functions
Vector (amortized doubling)
BST (amortized successor)
No recursion (unless you really wanna use it)
C++ constructs/elements (similar to exam 2 but more involved than constructor/destructor)
    copy constructor related question
    if you have a pointer in your struct, you probably need a destructor, copy constructor, and assignment
    operator overloading
