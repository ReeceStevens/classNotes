References are a "reference to something else"
when you change a reference, you change whatever it is you're referring to

Mechanically, when you pass a parameter to a function accepting a reference, you're actually passing 
the address of your parameter. Then, inside the function, any time you reference the variable name 
the compiler automatically dereferences the address for you.

Problems arise when you start flinging references around without checking to make sure
immediate dereferencing won't break your code.
