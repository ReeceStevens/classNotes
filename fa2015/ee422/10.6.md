==========================

Polymorphism
------------
	Ability for the same code to be used with different types of objects and
	behave differently with each.
		ex: System.out.println() can print any type of object.

	A variable of type T can hold any object that is a subclass of T.
		Employee ed = new Lawyer();
	When a method is called on ed, it behaves as a Lawyer
