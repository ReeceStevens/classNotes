Array Programming (see scratch file)

Insertion Sort
    How do we sort a deck of cards?
    Insert each element into a new array, placing it in the correct position at every move.
    You've seen this before.

Math methods and keyboard input
   Java uses scanners.
   Scanner has .next<type>() methods that grab the next <type> input by the user. 
   See examples in ArrayProgram.java (in scratch programs folder under 9.3)
