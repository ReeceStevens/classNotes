EE 422C Discussion -- Project 3 Overview
========================================

Breadth-first search (recommended project 3 solution mechanism)
	Basically move through the whole tree, keeping 
	track of the nodes you've already visited

	keep a "visited" field in each node object so you can 
	keep track of where you've been

	Finds the shortest path

Depth-first search	
	Goes until it hits a dead-end-- finds the longest path
