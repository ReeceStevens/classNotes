Algorithm Analysis
Big Oh
	T(N) is O(F(N)) if there are positive constants c and n0 such that
	T(N) <= cF(N) when N >= n0.
	
	F(N) is a function that bounds the growth rate of T(N).

Big Omega 
	Same as Big Oh, but a lower bound.

Big Theta	
	Sandwiches a function between both a lower and upper bound that takes
	the same shape as the function

ArrayLists
	Collection: an object that stores data. aka "data structure"
	stores elements
	typical operations: add remove clear contains(search) size
	ex: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, TreeSet, PriorityQueue
		(all contained in java.util.*)

	Abstract sets are like interfaces, but with actual classes
		can only have one inherited class.
		check out inheritence flow chart tree on javadocs or the class slideshow

	List: a collection storing an ordered sequence of elements
		0 based index
		has a size
		in java, ArrayList

	ArrayList can be resized (not immutable)
		Use type generics

	ArrayList<Type> name = new ArrayList<Type>();
		Type is a type parameter of a generic class. 
		You can store lists of different types as long as they are 	
			connected by a generic class.

	storing a value: a.add(value)
	getting a value: a.get(index)

Wrapper classes must be used for primitives (Integer, Double, Character, Boolean, etc)

Sets
	A collection of unique values, no order, no duplicates, that can add, remove, and search 
	add() -> O(1)
	contains -> O(N)
	remove -> O(N)

Hash
	Map a large domain of values to a smaller fixed domain
		typically, a set of elements to integer indexes in an array
	Hash function: an algorithm that maps values to indexes
