Classes and Objects
    Class -- a program entity that represents either:
        1. A program or module,
        2. A template for a new type of object.
        Examples: String, Random, JFileChooser, Scanner, File, etc.

    Object -- an entity that combines state and behavior
        1. Object Oriented Programming (OOP): Programs that perform
           their behavior as interactions between objects

    Students example:
        Each student is an object.
        Fields are names and numbers associated with the student.
        Methods are formulas associated with the student (like grade average)

    A class introduces abstraction-- the interface to the object maintains consistent behavior.
