==========================

Iterators (cont'd) and Recursion
Agenda
	Write an iterator for the Array class
	Recursion
	Recursive backtracking

Recursive backtracking
	Keep track of where you've been (Knight problem, maze problem)

	... this is a really bad explanation of an exhaustive search.

	Pseudocode
	if (all squares visited)
		print solution;
		return true;
	else 
		a) Add one of the remaining next 8 unvisited moves to the solution and recursively check
		   if this leads to a solution
		b) if the move chosen in (a) doesn't give a solution, remove this from solution vector.
		   Try other alternative moves.
		c) If no alternative works, return false. False is returned by the top call if there is
		   no solution.
