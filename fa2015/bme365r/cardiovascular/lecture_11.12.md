BME 365R Lecture -- 11.12.15
============================
Last time: mechanical overview of fluid dynamics of the heart

Today: elecrical aspects of the heart

Cardiac Muscle Cells
--
Bulk of heart tissue is the myocardium
Combination of features in other cells:
	Striated (similar to skeletal muscle)
	High volume of mitochondria (1/3 of cell volume)
	Looking at the sarcomere
	Sarcoplasmic reticulum
	T-tubule structures (deep dips in the cell membrane)
		increases surface area for AP conduction
	If someone has a myocardial infarct, check their blood troponin levels
		damaged cardiac cells release the troponin in the sarcomeres
		increased blood troponin -> heart attack
	Slide 9 cell: green is actin, red is alpha actinin (Z-line structural protein)
		can control the cell surface and alter cell adhesion

Tissue Structure
--
Assemble in tight layers
	adjacent cells are joined end-to-end by intercalated disks
		mediated by desmosomes, very strong tensile strength
	Gap junction -- electrically connects adjacent cells
		connect cytoplasm
		connexin protein family => gap junctions
	EC Coupling in cardiac muscles
		AP stimulates openning of calcium transport protein
		increase of intracellular Ca -> release of more intracellular Ca from stores in sarcoplasmic R.
		Ca binds to troponin, produces muscle contraction (whole ratchet process)
		Ca unbinds at muscle relaxation
	If we want to control force, 
		-> control the number of active cross-bridges
		1 way: control release of calcium (graded system)
Action potential stages
	Phase 4 -- resting potential (unstimulated)
	Phase 0 -- Na+ channels open (rapid depolarization event)
	Phase 1 -- Na+ channels shut
	Phase 2 -- Ca2+ channels slowly open, fast K+ channels close
	Phase 3 -- Ca2+ channels  close, slow K+ channels open
	Phase 4 -- resting potential (unstimulated)
	*Calcium influx determiens the characteristic time scale of cardiac action potential*
		contrast with neurons, time scale of 1 ms
	Long refractory time is critical for cardiac muscle cell function
		~200msec or more
		prevents tetanus, allows heart to fill with blood
Action potential of pacemaker cells (myocardial autorhythmic cells)
	Much higher resting potential (-60); it's actually unstable, drifts frequently
	gradually becomes less negative until it hits a threshold (~ -40mV)
	If two cells fire different cells, heart cells follow the fastest one

Organism level
--
Summation of all action potentials in the heart => ECG
partial block of the AV node (first ECG pathology slide, slide 34)
(Slide 35) Missing p waves and irregular heartbeat (Atrial Fibrillation)
	mild symptoms
	signals from root of pulmonary vein, etc. overwhelming the SA node signal
	Usually can be corrected w/ drugs or surgery 
(Slide 36) Don't see pretty much anything recognizable. (Ventricular Fibrillation)
	major sudden, lethal arhythmia --> ischemic heart disease is usual culprit
	possible solution -> defibrillator. very short time window, though.
