Case Study 1
--
74 year old woman
	- shortness of breath
	- worsens upon exertion
	- ankle swelling
	- reduced appetite
	- rheumatic fever when in 20s
	- jugular veins distended
	- heart has lowpitched, rumbling systolic murmur
		- heard over left upper sternal border (patient's left)
	- Extra S_3 sound
	- Pitting edema in ankles
		- pushing on ankle leaves a lingering indentation
Notes:
	- low-pitched, rumbling murmer is usually due to a stenotic valve (narrowed)
		- based on location of noise, probably over a pulmonary valve in upper quadrant
		- if leaflets aren't fully opening, resistence to flow of blood --> turbulent flow --> sound
	- Extra S_3 heart sound
		S-1 -- closing of AV valve (lub)
		S-2 -- closing of semilunar valves (dub)
		S-3 -- not quite known; possibly ventricular wall tension causes blood to push against wall	
			- Might indicate some pathology in the ventrical wall
	- History of Rheumatic fever
		- pretty common for this age group
		- complication of a strep infection 
		- antigens from some bacteria are similar to heart tissue angigens
			- possible immune response to destroy pericardium/myocardium/endocardium
		 	- most commonly affects left side of the heart
	- Pitting edema
		- fluid escaping from the peripheral capillaries into the interstitail spaces of the leg,
		- elevated systemic venous pressure
	- Enlarged jugular vein
	
Diagnosis:
	- Congestive heart failure
		- not curable, chronic condition
	- narrowing of heart valve --> heart failure
		- unable to generate enough cardiac output
	- mechanical defect of the heart

Left heart failure
	- shortness of breath,
	- crackling lungs, decreased exercise tolerance, cough, weakness, fatigue, mental status changes
Right side heart failure
	- decreased exercise tolerance, weakness, edema, hepatomegaly, weight gain, ascites, extra heart sounds

How will the patient's body compensate?
Short Term
	- increased afterload --> decreased right ventricular stroke volume
		- have to either (i) increase strength of each contraction or (ii) increase heart rate
		- response managed by the baroreceptor reflex
	- likely that system cannot completely compensate, so reduced blood flow to "less vital" organs 
		- i.e. digestive organs
Long Term
	- Heart adaps over long term by hypertrophy (muscle layers added to wall of heart)
		- mechanical limits to this solution (as wall thickness increases, maximum blood volume decreases)
		- Concentric hypertrophy --> thickness of wall increases but overall diameter doesn't change much
			- silhouette of heart on xray stays the same

Prescription:
	- Use a drug that increases strength of individual contractions
		- positive ionotrophic drug
		- Drug: Digoxin --> slows HR, increases contractility strength
			- blocks ATPase pump in cardiomyocyte
			- increases intracelluar Ca2+, reduced exchanging Ca2+ but increases contraction strength

Case 2: slide 31
	3 to 1 block
		atrial flutter
		1 in every 3 atrial AP actually conducts through the heart
