BME 365R Lecture -- 11.10.15
============================

Cardiovascular Physiology
--
Reading: Ch. 14-16
Sticking closely to the textbook. Need to read ahead.
Three key topics:
	- Heart
	- Blood Vessels
	- Blood

This week:
	Overview of cardiovascular system
	heart anatomy
	heart as a pump: focus on mechanical aspects
		- pressure-volume loop
		- Cardiac ultrasound to diagnose defects
	heart as a pump: focus on electrical aspects
		- Cardiac muscle cell

Functions of the Cardiovascular System
--
Transports materials through the body
	1. Water, nutrients, gases
	2. Materials that move from cells to cells (hormones, cytokines, etc.)
	3. Wastes (CO2, metabolic waste, heat)
Major organ systems
	- Brain
	- Lungs
	- Liver
	- Digestive Tract
	- Kidneys
	- Skeletal muscles
	- Adipose tissue
	- Skin
Heart central separation called the septum
	Each half of the heart is a separate pumping system
	Upper part (Atrium) and lower part (ventricle)
Blood flows because of a pressure gradient.

Heart Anatomy
--
Heart is hollow, encased with a membranous fluid-filled sac, the pericardium
	pointed side of the heart (apex) is angled down and to the left

Inside the heart
	myocardium (walls of the heart, heart muscles)
	endocardium (inner lining of the heart)
	
Heart contracts in two distinct stages (lub-dub)
	1. Right and left atrium contract at the same time
	2. Ventricles contract together to propel blood out of the blood

Heart as a Pump
--
lub dub is a vibration of the valves closing 
	AV valves -- between each atrium and ventricle
		Tricuspid valve -- three flaps
		Bicuspid/Mitral valve -- two flaps
	Semilunar valves -- between each ventricle and artery	
		
Two phases: diastole (cardiac muscle relaxes)
			systole (cardiac muscle contracts)
Cardiac Cycle: mechanical events
	1. Late Diastole: Passive filling of ventricles, valves open
	2. Atrial Systole: atrial contraction, ventricular pressure increases *slightly* 
	3. Isovolumic ventricular contraction: AV valves close, blood can't backflow and hits the valves, creating first "lub". pressure increases *greatly*. No movement yet.
	4. Ventricular ejection: After ventricular pressure exceeds that of the aorta, semilunar valves open
		volume left in the ventricle after pump:about half of the end diastolic volume
	5. Isovolumic ventricular relaxation: semilunar valves close "dub". pressure falls until it is below atrial pressure, AV valve opens. Cycle start again 

Each beat is about 2.4 oz of blood
