BME 365R Lecture -- 11.24.15
============================
Exam is the first day back after Thanksgiving (poop).

Last time's case study
--
Treatment: Balloon angioplasty

Stenting
--
- Bare metal (stainless steel, cobalt chromium alloy)
- Drug-eluting
	platform, polymer coating plus drug
		elute antiproliferatives, immunosupressants, anti-inflammatories, anti-thrombotic, etc.
Controversy over when it is appropriate to use each
	bare metal: high likelihood of scar tissue formation that could occlude vessel (restenosis)
		fast time span (weeks), higher risk
	drug eluting: can delay healing process; slow time span (years), lower risk

Constituents of Blood
--
Red Blood Cells (2x8um) - 45% of total volume
Hematocrit: volumetric fraction of RBCs in the blood
White blood cells - ~1/600 of RBCs
Platelet(2.5um) - 1/20 of RBCs, irregularly shaped and active in blood clot formation
Plasma - 90% water, 7% protein (albumin, immunoglobulin, lipoprotein, fibrinogen)

Blood density: 1.05 g/cm3

White blood cell types:
	- Lymphocytes
	- Monocytes
	- Neutrophils
	- Eosinophils
	- Basophils
Monocytes that leave bloodstream and enter tissue become macrophages
basophils that enter tissue environment -> cytokines, mediate immune response (mast cells)
Hematopoiesis
	model system for progenitor cell formation into specific cell types
	Pluripotent precursor cells (located in bone marrow)
	Each stage is an activation or repression of different genetic subroutines
	Begins early in embryonic development (within 3 weeks)
	Happens in spleen, bone marrow, and liver
	In adulthood, only happens in bone marrow
		See slide 11 for specific locations

Focus on Red Blood Cells
--
Erthropoietin (EPO) is a hormone synthesized in the kidneys. Triggers more RBC synthesis.
Can be used to stimulate the genesis of blood cells (both red and white)
Low iron = red blood cell disorders
	- fatigue
	- cold feeling
Elevated iron = polycythemia

Platelets
--
plug hole in time for body to heal lesion; then broken up by plasmin over time.
