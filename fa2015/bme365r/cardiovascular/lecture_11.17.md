Autonomic Inputs to the Heart
--
Heart beat is initiated by the autorhythmic cells in the SA Node
How does one signal get started and regulated?

- Sympathetic System
	Speeds up heart rate
	Norepinephereine -- sympathetic neurons
	epinephrine -- adrenal medulla
	Bind to beta adrenergic receptors
		-> increases in ion flow through If and Ca2+ channels
	Pharmacological:
		Chatecholamines
			bind to beta receptors
			--> activate cAMP second messenger system
			--> phosphorylize Ca2+ channels and Phospholamban
			See flow chart on slide 8.
			Phospholamban (integral membrane protein)
				blocks unphosphorylated state of ATPase
				--> increased Ca2+-ATPase on sarcoplasmic reticulum
					higher Ca2+ reserves and also faster turn around time
					--> faster and stronger contractions
- Parasympathetic System
	Slows down heart rate
	Acetylcholine (Ach) 
	Activates muscarinic cholinergic receptors
	increases K+ permeability, hyperpolarizing the cells
	Decreases Ca2+ permeability
	Longer time to reach the threshold potential

Arteries
--
Layers of connective tissue, smooth muscle, and endothelium.
Artery
	Mean diameter: 4mm
	Wall thickness: 1mm
	Lots of elastic tissue to store energy
Arteriole
	Mean diameter: 30um
	Wall thickness: 6um
	only smooth muscle and endothelium, no elastic tissue
	Can change diameter based on vasoconstriction or vasodilation
Capillary
	Mean diameter: 8um
	Wall thickness: 0.5 um
	Only endothelium. 
	*basal lamina* -- matrix inside the capillary
	water-filled pores throughout the capillary
	size of these pores varies through different organs.
		--> virtually none in the brain, lungs
	Pericytes -- supportive cells that surround capillary cells
		influence growth of new vessels, branching patterns, determining how permeable/leaky
		the endothelial layer of a particular area is (local control mechanism)		
Precapillary sphincters control how much blood flows from a metarteriole to an adjacent
	capillary bed.	
	Failure of the sphincter -> edema

Veins
--
Venule
	Diameter: 20 um
	Wall thickness: 1um
Vein
	Diameter: 5 mm
	Wall thickness: 0.5 mm
	some have one-way valves to ensure no backwash of blood.
Most of the blood is in the veinous system
	84% of systemic circulation
		64% veins
		13% arteries
		7% arterioles and capillaries
	7% heart
	9% pulmonary vessels
More veins, bigger volume
	about half the wall thickness

Blood Pressure
--
Pressure travels about 1 order of magnitude faster than blood itself
Mean Arterial Pressure --> time weighted average of the pressure in the arteries.
	See formula on slide 29
Depends on 
	- Blood volume (fluid intake, fluid loss)
	- Effectiveness of heart as a pump (heart rate, stroke volume)
	- Resistence of system to blood flow (diameter of arterioles)
	- Relative distribution of blood in system (diameter of veins)
