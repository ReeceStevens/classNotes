Fluid Dynamics for Blood Flow
--
Mean arterial pressure is the driving force for blood flow
Factors affecting mean arterial pressure:
	blood volume
		blood is 25% of ECF
		~ 5L total volume of blood for a 70 kG male
		2L cells, 3L plasma
		plasma is 92% water (by weight)
				  7% protein
				  1% everything else
		Kidneys respond to changes in blood volume by excreting excess water or retaining it
		Losing blood volume is harder for our physiology to respond to, since kidneys can only
			conserve existing blood volume

Poiseuille's law of blood flow
	volume flow rate is directly proportional to pressure, inversely proportional to resistence
	resistence itself is inversely proportional to radius of pipe ^ 4
Viscosity
	Ratio of RBC to plasma (called hemocrit)
	Protein content
	during rapid periods of growth, hemocrit is lower
	chronic kidney failure can lower hemocrit by not stimulating RBC creation
	different pathologies raise the hemocrit
	Pathology:
		Hypoxia, dehydration, etc.
		Primary polycythemia hemocrit
			mostly a genetic imbalance
			normal hemocrit: 40-45%
			pathological: 70-80%
			Consequences:  vascular system is "markedly engorged" with blood
						   circulation time is increased up to 2x
						   viscosity increases 5x normal
						   capillaries plugged by viscous blood
						   high risk of thrombotic events (deep vein thrombosis,
								heart attack, stroke)
In order to mobilize more blood, the body dilates the blood vessels (more efficient by a power of 4
	than increasing blood pressure)
	vasodilation produces a 5-fold increase in blood flow with a nominal change in blood pressure.
	correspondingly, even a small occlusion can have a dramatic effect on volume flow rate

Deviation from Ideal Blood Flow
--
Blood flow is pulsatile flow
	sinusoidal pressure gradient in a rigid pipe (Womersley number)
	=> turbulence: appearance of random fluctuations in the flow
	pronounced when flow rate increases (i.e. exercise conditions)
	Reynolds number (Re) --> ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces
	Turbulence occurs in normal physiology
		Found at junction of two vessels (called anastamoses)
		both arteries and veins
		Pathology:
			twin-twin transfusion syndrome
			turbulence in shared placenta -> uneven blood flow between zygotes
	For newtonian fluids, shear stress proportional to strain rate
		non-newtonian, may be time-dependent and definitely non-linear 

Case Study 1
--
13-year-old girl (no medical history) setting up instrument 
	sudden onset of numbness in index finger of left hand
		skin pale (blanching) and cold
		15 minute period of warming, sensation recovers
		burning sensation as skin turned bright red
		~20 min later, skin returns to normal.
	Pathology: Raynaud phenomenon
	Vasospasms produced as a result of stress or strong emotions
		can be recurring or sporatic
		color change --> sinosis (reduced oxygen to the tissue)
	Treatment for extreme, chronic case:
		Prevent skin atrophy, subcutaneous muscle damage
		Give a vasodilator drug
			binds to calcium; decrease Ca2+ to relax smooth muscle contractions
	
Case Study 2
--
57-year old man -> chest pain, nausea, pallor sweating
Wife gives him asprin
	-> cox inhibitors 
	prevents clotting (doesn't really change viscosity of blood, so not really a blood thinner)
	taking asprin slows down clot formation
EMTs give him O2 and start an IV of isotonic solution
	prevent hypoxia of brain and heart
	isotonic saline -> increases volume of ECF
At hospital, first test is for troponin levels (check for damage to cardiomyocytes)
ECG test shows enlarged Q wave, inverted T wave
	disruption of Q wave --> problem in ventricle depolarization
Coronary angiogram determines that an artery is >50% occluded
Treatment of atherosclerosis:
	endartectomy
	angioplasty and stenting (much more conservative approach)
