BME 365R Lecture -- 11.3.15
===========================

Consciousness
--
Understanding that you are you, and you are distinct from everything else around you.
How do we interpret all of our sensory input?
	Our perception of these inputs is unique for every person and is weighted by your past experiences
There are altered states of consciousness: coma, sleeping, dreaming, psychadelics/hallucinogenics, inebriation

Memory
--
Two kinds:
	Declarative (Explicit)
		Language, abstract thought
		requires a conscious record
		temporal lobe(processing), hippocampus (processing), LTP
		Involves all of the cortex
		Glutamate long-term potentiation
	Non-declarative (Implicit)
		new motor and sensory skills
		habituation, sensitization
		basal ganglion, cerebellum, pre-synaptic-facilitation
	
Declarative
	Two stages: 
		1. Short Term Memory 
			hours to weeks
			enhanced synapses
		2. Long Term Memory 
			weeks to years
			new synapses
			new neural networks	

	Sensory input --> STM --> LTM
						|-->   |--> Conscious recall --> sensory output
					|-------------------------------|
    					This is memory consolidation

	Stimulation of area 18 in occipital lobe results in a recollection of a visual memory
	Stimulation of areas 41, 42 (association auditory)
		-> you will hear people talking to you (auditory memories)
	
	Short Term
		associative learning (presynaptic modulation)
		changes weighting of the incoming action potential
	Declarative explicit memory mostly uses Hebb Synapse format
	See Long-Term Potentiation -- upregulation of signal feeds back 	

Memory Facts
	Gradual loss of all stored information or the ability to recall with time (forgetting)
	Memory is enhhanced by repitition or refreshing.
	Widely distributed throughout the cortex (sensory association cortex)
		typically sensory memories are located near where the signal came in
		locations, smells, and sounds form very strong memories that can evoke emotional responses
	Forgetting can be a powerful tool for mental health --> don't dwell on bad events
	deficits are seldom the result of localized lesions, but rather a deficit in the ability of the rest of the cortex to compensate
	we don't make memories of things that have no particular relevance to us.
	Strong memory formation:
		strong emotional responses
		Extreme scenarios
		Association

Hippocampus
	Defects produce short term memory defecs
		Patient with bilateral hippocampus ablation
		Often was done to reduce epilepsy in old medicine
		Oldest memories were preserved
	Electroshock therapy disrupts recent memories more than long term memories
		basically erases memories.
		Used for people who are depressed and aren't responsive to medicine
		You can eventually erase the memory that is causing the depression
	Concept cells translate awareness into long term memory
		group of neurons that convert your memory into a long-term trace

Limbic System 
	Oldest part of the brain
	Olfactory goes into amygdala --> declarative, explicit memory
		Many animals use smell for reproduction
		Even though smell is reduced in humans, we still have it hardwired to memory
		amygdala == strong emotions (love, hate, rage, etc)
			attached to hippocampus, modulates importance of memories
	**** Great Limbic Circuit of Papez (must memorize) **** Slide 14
		Looping through this circuit is what strengthens memories
		goes from cingulate gyrus to cortex and then back to the hippocampus
	Medial temporal lobe
		hippocampus and adjacent temporal lobe
		About 10^9 cells
		About 10^4 concepts per person in quick recall.
		Each concept has about 10^5 cells
	Concept Cells (Networks)
		link perception to memory
		minimize a lot of unimportant details
		extract meaning to make new associations and memories

Alzheimer's Disease
--
Signature lesion
	-- neurofibrillary tangle
	brain shrinks
	Abeta peptides
Challenge is to detect Alzheimer's before the tangles actually form (early detection)
Earliest change is mitochondrial swelling and loss of christae;
 protein buildup is strongest in hippocampus
Two defects
	tau defect
	beta amyloid defect

viscious cycle of stress
--
	stress signal in frontal cortex
	--> amygdala to locus coeruleus
	--> release more endogenous steriods and adrenergic response
