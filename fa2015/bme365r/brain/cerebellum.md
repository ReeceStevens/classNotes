Cerebellum (the "other" brain)
------------------------------
Primarily motor functions
Motor subprograms
	1. Basal Ganglia (extrapyramidal)
	2. Cerebellum
Extremely old
Divided by archi cellebelum (oldest)
			paleo cerebellum
			neo cerebellum (newest)
Cerebellar problems can result from basalar artery strokes
Functional parts
	Ipsilateral (controls same side of body; right controls right)
Attached to Pons through three white matter tracts
Small gyri mean that the cerebellum is highly folded; has same surface area as one of the
	cerebral cortices
Cranial nerve 5 (trigeminal) comes off of the pons
	6,7,8 (pontomedullary junction)
	9,10,11 (travel together through posterior fossa, medullary part of brain stem)
	12 (medulla)
Slide 8 landmarks
	- Middle cerebellar peduncle
	- restiform body (inferior cerebellar peduncle)
	- inferiror olivary nucleus (ION)
	- fastigial nuclei (fastigii)
	- globiform, emboliform
	- dentatus
Slide 9
	- ION is huge 
	- Medial lemniscal pathway runs up the middle
		- Motor, proprioception, etc. converging in the pons
Cerebellum is a comparator
	Cortex (where we want to go) --> cerebellum --> motor system (pyramidal) --> Movement
									 ^-	sensory information (Ia,Ib,II fibers) <-|
	Creates a trajectory or pathway of movement from where we want to be and where we are
	Compares sensory input and information from the cortex to design the motion pathway
Slide 12
	A,B -- from below
		Dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts
		unconscious proprioception
		converge in Mossy fibers
		spino-olivocerebellar and spino-reticulocerebellar are climbing fibers
	C -- from above
		cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway	
			contributes to Mossy fibers
		cortico-olivo-cerebellar
			contributes to climbing fibers
UNDERSTAND AND MEMORIZE SLIDE 13 DIAGRAM FOR CEREBELLAR FUNCTION
	Starting with neocellebellar pathways
		bottom left: pyramidal system (executor)
		prefrontal cortex to pons
		lateral lobe (computes motor algorithm)
		All cerebellar output is on a very small number of cells (Perkengi cells?)
			output is ALL inhibitor. it cannot excite
		Dentate nucleus -> vl thalamus -> cortex
		Iferior olivary nucleus axon goes up to perkengi cells; any time it fires, the perkengi
			cells fire (produces a complex action potential)
			- connection is excitory
			pings about every 1 second except for intense motor coordination, then up to 10 hz
				probably involved in timing, like computer clock cycle
	INtermediate lobe of cerebellum
		projects to globose emboliform nuclei
		projects to red nucleus and cortico rubral tract
	Very old (vertibular input)
		vermis lobe,
		vestibular nucleus and fastigial nucleus
		extrapyramidal tracts (used for posturing)
		-> reticulospinal tract	
	
	Cerebellar Cortex
		much simpler than cerebral cortex -- only three layers
			molecular
			perkengi cell layer
			granual cell layer -- more granular cells in cerebellum than in rest of brain
				granular cells are most common neurons in the brain *** quiz question ***
			Mossy fibers synapse on the granule cell dentrites

		Wiring:
			perkinje cells have outflow which goes to deep cerebellar nuclie
			granular cell is perpendicular to perkinje cells at molecular layer of cerebellum
		
		Cell types:
			Purkinje cells
				15 million, large 50 u diameter, 200K inputs, sole output of cerebellum,inhibitory
				biggest convergence of anywhere in the brain
			Granule Cells
				parallel fibers that aredensly packed 
			Basket Cells
			Stellate Cell
			Golgi cell
				-- these three are used to focus the signal, confine activty to certain regions
					in the cerebellum
		
		Fiber inputs
			Mossy Fibers	
				from cortex -> cerebellar glomerulus
			Climbing Fibers
				1 fiber per perkinje cell, branch up to 10 PCs 
		
		Know anatomy on slide 22

	Simple and complex spikes
		Slide 23: action potentials read off of a perkinje cell.
			they have maintained activity; will fire with no input whatsoever
			number of spikes per unit time is a function of the input excitation from
				the parallel fibers
			Big AP is from the climbing fiber
				after the climbing fiber, activity is somewhat suppressed
			number of spikes on the big AP
		Like a hard-wired computer
			fixed input produces a fixed output
			no reverberations, straight one-direction processing
			A lot of divergence (1000:1) btwn mossy fibers : climbing fibers
			Huge convergence to 15 million output convergence
			Independent modules map 1:1 to specific body locations
			plasticity in parallel fiber/purkinge synapse
				can be changed in a matter of hours
				you *learn muscle memory and coordination* at the purkinge/parallel fiber synapse
		Cerebral learning
			two schools of thought
			I. climbing fiber AP to PC, stores level of activity via reinforcing synapse. 
				reinforces repeated behavior
			II. (Rylander's on this bus) if you think of PCs as 0 or 1, a climbing fiber fire 
				results in a "read" signal that is the number of APs riding on top of the complex
				spike. indicates how many spikes have happened beforehand.
			Output of PC modifies signals, coordinates motor movement

	Functional divisions of cerebellum
		vestibulocerebellum
			disturbances in equilibrium, walking, balance
		spinocerebellum
			changes postural reflexes, can result in hyper or hypotonic
		pontocerebellum
			most important
			homolateral hypotonia and ataxia of extremities
			Become clumbsy
			intention tremor -- only manifest the tremor during activity (opposite of parkinsons
				resting tremor)
			Symptoms
				pass-point, overshooting the nose to finger test because of intention tremor
				Disdydocalkinesia -- can't perform rapid, alternating movements
				scatty, spitting speech
		see slide 30 for full list

	Diagnostic hints
		test proprioception
			two-point discrimination or tuning fork
		Requires movement
			walking, gait, hand-eye coordination
		Ipsylateral manifestation
		Acute pathology produces more symptoms
		frontal lobe problem produces similar issues coupled with problems with cognative issues
			i.e. difficulty processing information	
			
	Pathology
		Hemorrhage -- hypertension
		Tumors -- very common.
			adults: metastatic
			children: astrocytoma, medulloblastoma
				manifestation is motor difficulties (ataxia)
				also could be hemangioblastoma -- autosomal dominant genetic disease	

	Cerebellum is also important in sensing
	
	Test coordination via a video game
		Create some kind of stimulus and force the player to follow the stimulus
		can plot the lag time of the response with respect to the input
		plot the transfer function to determine the frequency cutoff for response time
