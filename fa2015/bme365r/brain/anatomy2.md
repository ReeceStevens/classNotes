Anatomy 2 Lecture -- 10.13.15
=============================

Meningitis
    Viral -- we don't have much of a cure
    Pus where CSF should be.
    Culture the CSF to determine if it's bacterial
    CSF should be acellular
    Can lose your hearing 
        Young patient, meningitis kills hair cells in inner ear
        --> sudden deafness
        fever, stiff neck, stiffness of body
    Ameobic abcess --> high fatality rate, no good treatment

Circulation in the brain
--
3 minute reserve
Circle of Willis
Blood enters through
    2 vertebral arteries --> basalar artery
    Carotid artery (common --> external and internal)
        internal carotid -->interior 2/3 of the brain's blood supply
            artery pierces a vein (the cavernous sinus)
            opthalmic artery is the first branch of the internal carotid
                --> first place a blood clot travels is to the eye
            Amarosis fugax (sudden transient blindness in one eye)
                Only cause can be an interruption in blood flow to the eye
                Tests:
                    Carotid dopplar, look for plaque
                    Check heart (in case of arhythmia)

             Carotid--Cavernous Sinus Fistula
                   Tear in the artery as it enters the vein
                   arterial (high-pressure) blood goes into vein
                    opthalmic vein dilates and blood goes to the eye
                Ablate the fistula via a catheter w/ wire or balloon (embolyzation)

Two major circulations
    Internal carotid -- interior 2/3
    posterior -- occipital cortex and lower temporal lobe
    
    Circle of Willis
        2 vertebral
        2 internal carotid
        You can block 3 of these 4 and still perfuse the brain
        Communicating arteries connect the big 4 
    
    middle cerebral artery takes a right angle turn at the trigone
        common place for an embolus to lodge
        sudden onset parysthesis
        weak motor control on one side
        right handed --> left hemisphere --> difficulty with speech
    most blood flow is on the surface (b/c the gray matter is on the surface)

    Lenticulostrite arteries (very small vessels) often have an intracranial hemorrhage
    
    anyeurism --> blood throughout cranium
        posterior communicating and basalar artery connection is most common
        anterior communcating and anterior vertebral artery
        intense headache
    LSA --> localized

Anatomy
--
Deeper part of the brain (oldpart) insular 
Look at diagram.

Sagittal section:
    - Cerebellum
    - medulla
    - pons
    - mesencephalon
        - cerebral peduncle
        - quadrageminal plate
    - pineal gland
    - posterior/ anterior commisure
    - fornix
    - 3rd ventrical
    - optic chiasm
    - optic recess
    - thalamus
    - hypothalamus
    - corpus collosum (right and left)
    - internal capsule (up and down) 
    - all motor goes to the end of the internal capsule
    - any time we see the 3rd ventricle, think thalamus
        - thalamus is medial to the internal capsule
    - Globos palladis
    - putamen
    - caudate
    - all three above are called the Basal Ganglia
    - thalamus is the great relay center of the brain (everything except olfaction)
    - Superior colliculus --> vision
    - inferior colliculus --> hearing
    - internal capsule turns into the cerebral peduncle
    - Cerebellum is held onto the brainstem by three tracts
        - superior
        - middle
        - inferior cerebellar peduncle
Look at the dissection cross section slides for names

Cranial Nerves
--
I -- Olfactory Nerve
    Doesn't exit the intracranial space
    Upper part of the cribiform plate
    Oldest sense
II -- Optic Nerve
    leaves through optic canal
    biggest of all cranial nerves
    Nasal fibers cross over in the optic chiasm
    Right visual field projects to left side of brain, vice versa
    tumor in optic chiasm
        --> loss of vision in both eyes
            bitemporal hemianopia
    Homonomous contralateral hemianopia --> loss of a particular side of the visual field
III, IV, VI -- oculomotor, trochlear, abducens nerves
    See Rylander's diagram on eye movement
V -- trigeminal nerve
    three branches
        opthalmic, mandibulary, and maxillary branches
    Sensory information on head
