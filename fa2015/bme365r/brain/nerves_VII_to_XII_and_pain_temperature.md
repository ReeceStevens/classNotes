Last time: 12 cranial nerves
Starting with Facial nerve (VII)

VII -- Facial Nerve  (don't confuse with nerve V)
--
	supplies innervations for facial expression
	taste (goes through inner ear) for anterior 2/3 of tongue
	Tear generation
	Passes through muscle in inner ear that modifies how much sound energy gets to cochlea
	Also goes to submandibular, sublingual, lacrimal, stapedius muscle (inner ear)
	Runs through the parotid gland but DOESN'T innervate it. (see IX)
	Pathology:
	Bell's Palsy
		Idiopathic hemi-facial paralysis
		(wake up one morning and suddently half of your face is paralyzed)
			cannot close eye, decreased lacrimation
			sound sensitivity -- sounds seem very loud
			taste is abnormal -- taste seems very abnormal
		Can't smile, wrinkle your forehead, or close your eye
		Can't tear up or close eye, so the cornea dries out.
		Usually resolves within weeks
			60 mG prednozone can help speed recovery
		Sometimes aberrant regeneration -- fibers are misaligned when they reattach 
		Syndrome of the crocodile tears (10% of patients)
			Instead of salivating, they will start crying (nerves have been miswired)
	Other pathology: lyme's disease, tumors, etc. But these are not idiopathic (i.e., we know their cause)

VIII -- Acoustic nerve
--
	Goes through the inner ear, passes auditory signals
	carries the impulse to give you balance

IX -- glossopharyngeal
--
	Posterior 1/3 of tongue (bitter taste)
	Several muscles in back of mouth to help with swallowing
	Goes to some special sensory organs in carotid that regulate blood flow and O2 consumption
	innervates parotid gland (helps in food digestion)
	Carotid sinus: stimulation decreases blood pressure by slowing heart rate and vasodilation
	Trick this gland by electrical stimulation to regulate blood pressure (in an engineering design)
	carotid body:
		measures co2 and o2 in ciculating blood. goes to respiratory center of the medulla and regulate the rate and depth of 
		respiration.

X -- Vagus
--
	Very big. Supplies autonomic innervations to all internal organs (heart, vega)
	slows heart rate since it's an Ach nerve
	Very important from an autonomic standpoint
	abdominal and thoracic viscera
	2 branches
		superior laryngyeal nerve: cricothyroid muscle
		recurrent laryngeal nerve: larynx and vocal cords (allows us to speak).
			Passes close to the thyroid gland; if thyroid is removed, sometimes this nerve can be damaged and lead to vocal damage
	Cough reflex
	Vomiting reflex

XI -- Accessory nerve
--
	Rotates head left and right

XII -- Hypoglossal
--
	Controls muscles in tongue (not taste)

Spinal cord
--
Review: sensory information is all dorsal in the spinal cord, join together inside the dura just inside the dorsal root ganglia.
	Sympathetic chains (connected to segmental nerves) -- like a parallel spinal cord
	
Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) -- cell bodies
Synapse inside the spinal cord grey matter
Dorsal back of the cord carries procreaception (?) VS-T and LS-T carry pain and temperature

Finding your way around the spinal cord
	Belly button is T10 (good landmark to know)	

Functional brain areas
--
Precentral gyrus -- motor strip
postcentral gyrus -- sensory, just behind central sulcus
broca's area -- motor control of speech
Lateral fissure (area 41, 42) -- where hearing projects
Occipital lobe -- all vision
Cerebellum -- mostly motor function
frontal lobe -- personality, cognitive thinking, mathematics, interpretive language skills

Can't actually see the parietal/occipital fissure
Calerine fissure

Numbering system for the functional parts of the brain
	hearing is 41,42
	18,19 are visual accessory areas (decode color, motion, relative positioning, etc.)
	17 is the picture of the vision (spatial, temporal representation)

* Switching to Pain and Temperature Slideshow *

Consiousness
--
We are connected to our environment by
	concious proprioception, 
	unconscious proprioception, 
	vision and hearing,
	skin,
	pain and temperature
All of these pathways go to the CNS from the thalamus through to the cortex

Receptor specificity
	receptors that are specifically tuned to a particular stimuli (photoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, etc)
Pathway specificity
	projecting certain pathways up to the brain
	optic nerve (signals are interpreted as vision), conscious proprioception, etc.
		electrical stimulation of optic nerve is perceived as a flash of light
		Receptors have crosstalk-- i.e. you can rub your eye and see a flash of light b/c you are mechanically stimulating photoreceptors
	phantom limb
		after an amputation, the brain still thinks the arm is there.
		Can lead to phantom limb pain (amputated limbs can feedback to pain neurons)

Temperature Receptors
--
Heterogeneous distribution
	Three nerve endings: 2 C-fibers, one A-delta fiber
	Acts like a differential amplifier
	Cold signalling system and hot signalling system
	at least 12 different protein channels for temperature perception
	Can percieve 0.2 degrees C change in temperature (we're great at change, just not absolute values)
	Not good at detecting actual temperature since we adjust to the normal temperature of the room	
	Methanol can trigger cold sensors
	many more cold receptors than warm receptors (more likely to die from cold than heat)

Zone of thermal neutrality
	20-40 degrees C
	Cold and warm receptors are firing togther to produce a differential input. 
	At a really high temperature, paradoxical cold takes place-- cold sensors start firing again (>45 degrees)
	
Pain
	Protopathic
		dull, chronic, poorly localized
		burn
		non-myelinated C-fibers (slow conducting but persistent)
	Epicritic
		sharp, short duration, well localized
		needle prick
		myelinated A-fibers (fast conduction, short life span)
			survival advantage, propogate sudden pain to brain very quickly
	Chronic pain (protopathic) 
		painkillers $100 billion industry

	Chemoreceptor sensitive to:
		K+ released from damaged cells (when you crush cells, K+ will be released since it is in such high intracellular concentration)
		bradykinin from white blood cells
		histamine
		Ach
		serotonin
		prostaglandins
			- asprin affects the prostaglandins

	Pathway starts on the skin
		directly stimulated by any of the above signals
		Generates an action potential in the sensor segment in the dendrite (not like normal)
			goes to dorsal root ganglion, then to spinal cord
		releases CGRP and Substance P, cause a "wheal and flare"
			mast cells are stimiulated by this release and gives off more histamine, further stimulating the pain pathway
			positive feedback cycle

	Four ways it gets to the brain
		Spinoreticular -- medullary reticular formation
			waking pathway (wakes you up if stimulated by pain)
		Spinotectal -- mesencephalon
			Third cranial nerve causes pupil to constrict; spinotectal improves vision by dilating pupils
		Major pathways:
		Lateral Spinothalamic tract
				
		Anterior Spinothalamic tract
			Light touch and tickle

Memorize: sketch of the pain pathway.
	All pain information crosses over to the opposite side of the spinal cord and passes up to the mesencephalon
		fourth order neuron goes into the postcentral gyrus
	
Sensory gating
	opiate-induced suppression of substance P
		gates the amount of pain that gets into the central nervous system
		"Pain threshold" can be modulated by what's going on in the environment
	Accupuncture has its basis in this concept of pain gating

Applications -- we can intentionally stimulate the generation of these opiates
	TENS -- transcutaneous electrical neural stimulation
		placing stimulator on the spinal cord that releases internal opiates w/o the risk of the patient getting addicted
		1 hour stimulation => a day or two of pain relief
	Electro-anesthesia
		
Messed-up dog experiment
	In artery:
		morphine + bradykinin => lots of pain, since morphine only acts centrally
		asprin + bradykinin => no pain, asprin blocks the bradykinin receptors
	In spinal cord:
		opposite

Biomimetics
	Stefan Boltzmann Law
		Total energy, E, radiated by a black body per unit surface area across all wavelengths per unit time (irradiance) E = sigmaT^4
	Two animals have extremely fine temperatue sensors
		Crotaline snakes
			eyes and pits -- pits are infared sensors
			Terminal nerve mass is very sensitive to infared energy
		Melanophila Acuminata
			Fire beetles -- can sense a fire 800 km away
			military applications: room-temperature night vision
			Infared lens gathers the photons: expands and contracts so that it pulls on a nerve ending
				sends an AP to the brain via a mechanical system
	=> Room temperature bolometer
