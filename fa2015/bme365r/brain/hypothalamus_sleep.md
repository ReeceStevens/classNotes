Hypothalamus 
------------
Autonomic and homeostatic functions
Endocrinology
Structural overview: The Diancephalon
	hypothalamus connected to pituitary gland by infundibulum
	Optic chiasm is very close to pituitary gland
	Lateral geniculate nucleus -- vision
	Medial geniculate nucleus -- hearing
Nuclei can be divided into six groupsa
	optical
	superoptical
	ventricular
	mamillary
	posterior 
	lateral
because optic chiasm is so close, vision often associated with hypothalamus pathology
Anterior pituitary (portal system)
	Releasing factors given off to pituitary gland which releases hormones
posterior pituitary (direct wiring)
	neuro hypothoseal part
	hormones are directly released into the posterior part of the pituitary

Anterior pituitary hormones and releasing factors
--
Anterior hypothalamic nucleus -- FSH (for females,prepares eggs in an ovary to be fertilized 
	(for males, spermatogenesis)
pre-optic area -- LH (induced ovulation and formation of corpus luteum)
	(for males, testosterone generation)
dorsal media hypothalamus -- Prolactin
	prepares breasts for lactation upon delivery of a child
	same in men and women, women just have more of it
anterior hypothalamus --ACTH, TSH
	ACTH -- triggers release of glucocorticoids; produces steroid-like substances.
			levels change in response to stress
			involved in immunological system
	TSH -- targets thyroid gland, causes release of T3 and T4 thyroxin; 
			thyroxin establishes the basal metabolic rate in the whole body
Arctuit nucleus -- GH 

Hypothalamus is a delicate feedback control system.
Cushing Disease
	can get Cushing syndrome from high doses of steroids like prednizone
		often happens when patients take steroids to reduce inflammation
	Increased secretion of ACTH
		weight gain, high BP, poor short-term memory
		irritability, excess hair growth, impaired immunological function
		red, ruddy face, extra fat around neck, fatigue, red stretch marks,
		poor concentration.	
		"Buffalo Hump" -- lump on back of the neck
	If someone experiences these symptoms and isn't taking steroids, its possible 
		they have a secretory tumor.
	If you get a tumor in the adrenal gland, you can get cushings syndrome; but when 
		you do a blood test, the ACTH level is very low.

In a peri-menopausal woman, the FSH levels in her body spike.
	infertility screen can be conducted by detecting spiked FSH levels (body trying to rev up
	egg production because the ovaries are unable to work)

Opposite to Cushings: Addision's Disease
	almost always caused by primary failure of the adrenal gland
	Lose weight, low blood pressure, hyperpigmentation, nausea, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia
	can be fatal.

Hyperthyroidism
	Toxic goiter or thyroid tumor
		very nervous, irritable, spiked HR, fever, sweating, lose weight, trouble sleeping
	T3 and T4 thyroxin
	If you have a tumor secreting too many thyroid hormones, the TSH level will drop.
		body reacting to the increase in thyroid hormones.

Hypothyroidism
	10% of population will experience hypothyroidism
	cold intolerance, weight gain, fatigue, decreased memory and concentration
	Thyroid gland isn't making enough hormones, spiked TSH level.

Goiters
	Two ways to get a goiter
		1. Thyroid tumor
		2. Pituitary tumor -- forces thyroid to work harder and harder, causing it to swell

Grave's Disease -- opthalmological complication of thyroid tumors
	Tumor in thyroid gland (usually in a goiter)
	Antibody proteins target muscles in the eye
	Symptom: portruding eyes (very prominent)

Vasopressin -- facilitate reabsobtion of water
Oxytocin -- releases milk. Baby teething initiates a neurological reflex arc that 
			triggers milk release
			Also triggers uterine contraction

ADH -- if no ADH, produce 18 liters of urine a day.
	controls water re-uptake
	diabetes incipitus

Hunger
	LH -- evokes eating behavior, can lead to anorexia if dysfunctional
	VMH -- cessation of eating, can lead to hyperphagia if dysfunctional
Also reponsible for the rage reflex
	destruction of these nuclei leads to a lot of aggression

Temperature
	AH -- sweating
	PH -- shivering

Autonomic Function
	hypothalamus is the controlling nucelus for the autonomic system
	parasympathetic response -- homeostasis
	sympathetic response -- fight or flight


Parasympathetic nervous system
	very long pre-ganglionic and short post-gangliotic
	Acetylcholine
	face, trunk, a little in the extermities
		primarily through the vagus nerve
	Know these nerves:	
		Oculomotor nerve (ACH)
		Greater superficial patrosal nerve (Nerve VII) -- submandibular
		Lesser petrosal nerve -- very important in secretion for the mouth
		
Sympathetic nervous system
	Does the opposite of the parasympathetic nervous system
	very short pre-ganglionic and long post-gangliotic
	Norepinepherine or epinepherine
		Cell bodies are in a spinal cord organ parallel to the spinal cord itself
		"Chain ganglia for the sympathetic nervous sytem"
			
Head and neck
	Sympathetic is very complex and comes from the superior calligulus,
		loops down to the cervical area, then goes all the way back up
	III nerve constricts pupil, but sympathetic diliates.

Important Syndrome: Horner's Syndrome
	tumor in upper lobe of the lung
	Tumor presses on sympathetic optical tract.
	Symptom: steady state pupil is smaller (b/c sympathetic tract is pressed on by tumor)
		Changes eye color in one eye; unequal pupils.

Blood pressure
	Cardiac output = heart rate * stroke volume
	heart rate
	contractility
	blood volume
	vascular resistance -- changes quickly, is a function of the sympathetic and 
		parasympathetic systems.
	Carotid sinus monitors the blood pressure, signals back up the ninth cranial nerve
		which goes to the hypothalamus, then initiates sympathetic/parasym response
	
Sleep
	Reticular activating system
		pons --> above the mesencephalon
		inputs from pain and temp, proprioception, auditory, visual, etc.(things that wake 
			you up)
		People who are comotose can be aroused for short periods of time can be woken up
		Reticular activating system is in charge of waking the brain up
	The bigger you are, the less sleep you need.
	
	Stages of sleep
		light sleep -- REM
		Deep sleep
		Goes on in cycles
		convert time signal to frequency --> power spectral density
			location of peak determines stage of sleep cycle
			deeper sleep --> lower frequency
		EMG -- you're almost paralyzed during REM sleep

	Master Clock
		Suprachiasmatic nucleus
		direct input from optic nerves
		24-hour light cycle important for circadian rhythm
		Also regulates FSH-LH cycle, so blindness --> infertility
		Depression --> sleep disorders

	Why sleep is important
		non-REM 
			repair free radical damage to membranes
		REM
			release of monoamine neurotransmitters ceases
			post-synaptic receptors are reset to full sensitivity
		remove unimportant memory traces

	Sleep disorders
		insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep walking, night terrors, restless leg syndrome,
		sleep apnea, snoring, sleep paralysis
