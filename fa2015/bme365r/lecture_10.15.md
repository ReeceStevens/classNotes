BME 365R Lecture -- 10.15.15
============================

Pain sensors
--
Allow us to get away from things that might hurt us
	Diabetes: peripheral neuropathy causes anesthesia in the legs
		- cold perception
		- ulcers, infections

Conscious Proprioception
--
Stereognosis -- determine what an object is without seeing it
Topognosis -- sense the location of touch
Types of sensation -- pallesthesia: vibration, kinesthesia: motion, somesthesia: well-being
Understanding of where your joints are in space, tension in muscles, orientation with respect to the rest of your body

Two point discrimination
	Ability to distinguish between two different stimuli points that are close together
	touch, pressure, vibration
	
Concept of receptive field
	Something with a larger physical extent is easier to identify because it is bigger than a receptive field
	Larger RF -> fewer neurons/unit area
		poor 2-point discrimination
	small RF -> many neurons/unit area (fingertips, etc)
		good 2-point discrimination

	forearm -- 40 mm^2
	lips -- 4.5 mm^2
	fingertip -- 2.3 mm^2
	tongue -- 1 mm^2
	retina -- 1 um^2
		-- basically like pixels in a camera on the eye
		-- 20/10 vision translates to 20 arc/seconds angle between two points
	Refined tone perception -> higher RF in cochlea

	Central Pathways
		**** memorize this next diagram ****
		3 neuron pathway from skin to brain
		From skin to dorsal root ganglia (without synapsing) and up the dorsal side of the spinal cord
		Granile and Cuneate nuclei is where the fibers synapse
		go into the internal arcuate fibers, which make up medial lemniscal pathway
		get to ventral postlateral nucleus
		-> thalamus to post-central gyrus (sensory)
		medulla 

	Sensory homunculus
	How does proprioception info from the eye get to the brain?
		Goes in through cranial nerve V (facial nerve)

	Lateral inhibition
		Ability to use signal processing and refine the incoming signal to enhance two point discrimination
		Works for all sensory modalities
		We've evolved this over time
		Any skin stimulus produces a blurred edge, not a delta function
			Skin acts like a low-pass filter to the signal
			Brain reconstructs what the real stimulus was
			We use inhibitory cells to weight these nerves; aberrant signals are inhibited twice as much
			Elaborate neural network that serves as a high-pass filter for the signal going up to the brain
				Helps with reconstructing sharp edges
			Intensity of signal can affect the accuracy of this process

	Diseases to know for this pathway
		Diseases that limit vibration or stereognosis

		- B12 Deficiency, or subacute combined degeneration, or pernicious anemia 
			- cure: just inject with B12
		- Neurosyphillis -- STD that causes a loss in 2-point discrimination
			- cure: pennicillin (100% curable)

	Receptors
		Touch receptors
			meissner's corpuscle
			pascinian corpuscle
				nerve ending with a shock absorber surrounding it
				As you apply force F(t), it responds dynamically as dF/dt	
				AC receptor
			Muscle spindle
				Linear fiber
				physical stretcthing of the membrane opens the pore -- mechanical receptor!
				Lots of these fibers surrounding hair follicles, gives us sensation via hair touch
				Primarily in the dermis	
		*** QUIZ QUESTION *** 
			if someone gets the right side of their spinal cord cut at C5, sensory loss will be:
				- pain and temperature on left side
				- proprioception on *right* side (sensory dissociation)

Unconscious Proprioception
--
Important for posture and motor coordination
basal ganglia and cerebellum
	DSCT and VSCT (dorsal/ventral spinal cord tract)
feedback mechanism for fine motor skills
cerebellum is a big motor subprogram that remembers muscular movements

Ia, II Muscle spindle -- detect muscle tension
	sends a large number of fibers in the conscious proprioception pathway
	ALSO a big player in the unconscious proprioception pathway
		muscle spindle is a muscle that is also a sensory receptor, running parallel to the big fibers we were talking about from earlier
	Ia fibers are the most important -- signal the amount of tension that is in the muscle
		innervated by the gamma motor neurons (as opposed to the big muscle fibers that are stimulated by alpha motor neurons)
	*** Understand the weight diagram ***
	Monosynaptic stretch reflex
		If you stimulate the Ia fiber, you get a reflex from the alpha motor neuron. Happens at the interface within the spinal cord
		Serves as an amplifier system: a small gamma input results in a large alpha output
		Important in posture
		See circuitry diagram in slideshow

Ib Golgi Tendon Organ
	Sensors that are in the tendon itself -- sense force
	stretch or contract -- understands static tension in the muscle
		goes to cerebellum and basal ganglia
	Golgi tendon reflex
		If you stretch the muscle, Ib prevents overextension
	
	****Memorize next diagram (after table of muscle fibers)****

Input to the cerebellum
--
	- Ia fibers also send info to dorsal spino-cerebelar tract (DSCT)
	- Ib fibers use Laminus 3,6,and 7 to superior cerebellar peduncle -- Ventral spino-crebellar tract (VSCT)

Anterior commissure is where pain and temp cross over in spinal cord
