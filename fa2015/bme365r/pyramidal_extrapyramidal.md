Lecture 10.20.15
=================

Big picture:
	idea -> pre-frontal cortex
		-> lateral cerebellum -> thalamus
		-> basal ganglia -> thalamus
	Both branches lead to motor cortex
		motor cortex -> pyramidal tract
		Extrapyramidal path
	Ultimately leads to movement
		Ia,Ib,II motor neurons send back sensory feedback to lateral cerebellum, motor cortex
	
Pyramidal System
--
	Mammalian system
	2 neuron pathway from cortex to motor neurons
	Effferent pathway from the cortex
	precentral gyrus in the frontal lobe
		- corticospinal tract
			cortex to spine
			90% crossed, 10% uncrossed
		- corticonuclear tract
			cortex to brian stem nuclei
				upper facial (crossed & uncrossed) -- facial paralysis indicates NOT an upper facial nerve lesion since it is doubly innervated
				lower facial (crossed only)
				hypoglossal (crossed only)
				spinal accessory (uncrossed only)	
	Point of crossing is in the medulla
		known as pyramidal decussation
		anything below this affects "same side"
		above this, "contralateral side"
	See cross-sections to get spatial orientation of pyramidal system
	
	Upper motor neuron lesion -- usually a stroke
		contralateral hemiplegia 
		lose fine movement of fingers and lips
		hypotony (no muscle contraction for 1 or 2 days)
			after a few days, turns spastic
		Abnormal reflexes
			Deep tendon reflexes become hyperactive
			Can accentuate so much that it oscillates
		Classic Release 
			upgoing toe reflex -- Babinski reflex
				(normally toes curl downward when sole is stroked, but babinski fans toes out)
		No muscle atrophy

	Lower motor neuron lesion -- polio (targets alpha motor neurons), ischemia 
		total flaccid paralysis
		muscle atrophy -- lack of innervation leads to muscle cell death
		same-side paralysis
		de-innervation supersensitivity -- Ach that is in the bloodstream causes a spontaneous muscle contraction
			fasiculations -- muscle ripples
		Can repair itself!
		Functional muscular stimulation to keep the muscles alive until the nerve can repair itself!
	
Extrapyramidal System
--
System that passes through the basal ganglia
	basal ganglia
		substantia niagra
		subthalamic nucleus
		red nucleus
		reticular formation
		vestibulospinal tract
	Rubrospinal Tract	
		red nucleus in mesencephalon, crosses midbrain, terminates in the cervical cord
		excitory to flexor motorneurons
		inhibitory to extensor  motor neurons
		afferents
			corticorubral
			cerebellorubral
	Reticulospinal tract
		lateral r.s. tract
			originates in medulla
			crossed & uncrossed
		medial r.s. tract
			originates from the pontine
			uncrossed
		projects the gamma motor neuron system.
		posture -- gamma MN input
		visceral functions: respiration, vasomotor
	Vestibulospinal tract
		lateral v.s.
		medial v.s.
		ipsilaterally into nucleus of VIII cranial nerve
		axial and proximal muscles -- important for posture as well
	All these paths help to bypass the pyramidal tract in the case of failure

	Basal Ganglia -- subprogram being addressed by the cortex
		caudate (neostriatum) -- relatively evolutionarily new
		putamen (neostriatum)-- relatively evolutionarily new
		globus pallidus (paleostiatum, outflow nucleus)-- relatively evolutionarily old
			processing output
		No execution of information, merely processing and relaying the information
			execution takes place in the pyramidal tract
			this tract smooths out muscle movement before execution
		Automatic patterned movement	
	Memorize this next diagram!

	All data goes into the caudate and putamen
		-> substantia niagra
			decreasing muscle activity (think sculpting motor information)
		outflow is the ancillar lenticularus
	Info is sent back into the cortex

	Inhibitory input -- limits oscillations and unwanted motor functions -- effect of the substantia nigra

	Parkinson's Disease
		1M affected by Parkinson's
		epidemic was caused by a bad batch of heroine on the west coast (within a week, caused bad parkinson's)
		Another bad outbreak after flu pandemic post-WWII (1M-10M).
		50,000 new cases every year
		median onset age is 60
		Loss of dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra
			Symptoms appear when >50% of cells are dead
		95% sporadic, 5% genetic
		Symptoms
			Pill rolling tremor -- resting tremor
			rigid
			slow movement (bradykinesia)
			impaired balance and gait
			expressionless face
		Pathology
			Cell stress
			misfolded proteins congregate
			intracellular protein clumps called Lewy Bodies	
			Chaperones start refolding proteins
			protein elimniation through ubiquinitin-proteasome system
			ubiquitin system overwhelmed, toxic proteins accumulate, cells die
		Genetic mutations
			Alpha-synuclein protein
			Mutant Parkin
		Treatment
			L-Dopa (precursor to dopamine that can cross the blood-brain barrier)
			Deep brain stimulation -- mostly for the thalamus, inhibits the tremor
			Stem cell transplants (functional benefit is modest despite 100K surviving dopaminergic cells)
				- originated in Brazil
				- put cells from adrenal gland and implanted it in the brain
					- almost 100% cure rate in the short term, but almost all failed over time.
					- didn't cure the underlying cause of parkinson's
			Gene therapy to inhibit overactive regions (subthalmic nucleus)
			Increase chaperonse activity in S. Nigra
			Glial deried neurotrophic factors
	Chorea
		Dieseased caudate
		uncontrolled motor movement
		Sydenham's Chorea
			post-streptococcal (1/500 chance for rheumatic (scarlet) fever, then 20-30% chance for syndenham's Chorea)
			Starts about 6 mos after the fever
			most recover fully after 6 mos
			Pennicillin is 100% cure rate
		Huntington's Chorea / Huntington's Disease
			autosomal dominant
			Dementia and movement disorder usually start 40 yoa
			50/50 chance of getting huntingtons if you have a parent with huntington's 
			mutant Hunting 10 protein that is misfolded
			affects caudate and putamen
			by the time of onset, 10 year life expectancy
				progressive demensia and motor defects
			No real treatment available.
			95% of children of huntingtons disease parents elect not to test for the gene.
	Athetosis
		slow, involuntary writhing movements
		Degernation of the corpus striatum (caudate and putamen)
			caused by cerebral palsey (hypoxia during birth)
			neonatal jaundice
