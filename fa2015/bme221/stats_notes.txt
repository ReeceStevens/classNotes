Anova and Post-Hoc Tests
========================
	External reference: http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/statbigchart.html
	Go read it, love it, know it.

Two types of hypotheses:
	Experimental
		Clearly identify a question that is testable.
		Make sure that your tests actually evaluate your own hypothesis
		Three-step process:
			General
				- identify general relationship between major variables of the question
			Directional
				- Revise general to identify the direction of a relationship (inverse, directly proportional, etc)
			Measurable
				- if _____ then _____ because _______.
				- Doesn't have to be exactly in this format for a paper, but it should be able to be written in this form.

	Statistical
		H_o (Null Hypothesis)
			- This means all groups are statistically equal (or, one group mean is greater than or equal to the other)
	
		H_a (Alternative Hypothesis/Hypotheses)
			- Not all of the means of the groups are equal

		A statistical test either "rejects" or "fails to reject"/"support" the null hypothesis.
			DOES NOT EVER PROVE.

Case Study: Cell Adhesion Background
	Does fibronectin (Fn) affect 3T3 adhesion?
		Fn is an ECM glycoprotein
		Binds to collagen, fibrin, etc.
		Cell membrane integrins bind to Fna
	Cell adhesion is dependent on divalent cations (Ca2+)
	Experimental hypothesis:
		Fn is going to affect the binding of 3T3 cells.
		Increasing Fn will cause better adhesion for the 3T3 cells.
		If we increase Fn, then the cell adhesion will increase because integrands in 3T3 cells should bind to the Fn.
	Statistical null hypothesis:
		For multiple batches of differing Fn concentrations, there will be no significant difference in adhesion between cultures.
	Alternative hypothesis:
		At least one is different.
	
	Experimental design:
		Multiple plates with varying concentrations of Fn. Use polystyrene surface; use three treatment levels: none, 1 unit Fn (low) , 10 unit Fn (high)	

ANOVA -- Analysis of Variance
	One-Way ANOVA
		1 dependent variable (measured value)
		1 categorical variable (2 or more groups of "treatments")
			If you only have two groups, you're just doing a t-test.
			Three or more groups produces an ANOVA.
		Answers the question: are all the means of the treatment groups "equal" (statistically)?

	Different ANOVA Types
		Fixed Effects -- we're using this one
		Random Effects

	What does ANOVA do? 
		look at the slides.

	In the end: get the p-value. Typically, use the alpha value of 0.05.

	If the p-value is lower than the alpha, the means are statistically different.

	Problem: you know that something is different, but you don't know which group.
		Can't do a T-test on each pair because it increases the chance of type I errors (false positives).
		Each test has an error proportional to your alpha value; for lots of tests, that error compounds.

	Answer:
		Post-Hoc Test
			Adjust the p-value threshold: that way, you can make the results significant
			Tukey's method, Scheffes method, or MATLAB!
			Bonferroni's correction: divide p by 1000. Extremely conservative

	Indicate statistically different data with bars or letters over bar graphs. Make it easy
	to see if the data is statistically different or not. If you use a notation system, be sure
	to document it.
