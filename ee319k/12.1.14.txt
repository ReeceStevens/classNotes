===============

1. All Homework grades are final this week (wince)
    a. Optional homework: Spring 2014 Final Exam DUE AT FINAL
        replaces one missed homework
    
Review for the Final
--------------------
    Pointers (Parameter Passing)
    Linked Lists
        struct Student {
            uint32_t id;
            uint8_t score;
            struct Student *next;
        }
        typedef struct Student sType;
        sType &sList;
        // Last element in list points to NULL
        // sList is the address of the first student in the class

        uint8_t Avg(sType *sl){
            uint32_t sum = 0; count = 0;
            while (sl){
                sum += sl->score;
                count ++;
                sl = sl->next; 
            }
        }
        if (count != 0){
            return (sum/count);
        } else {
            return 0;
        }

        Arrays versus Linked Lists
            Lookups (searches) dominate array
            Lots of changes: add or remove elements within a list
            

    Structs
        // Declaring a new data type
        struct Student {
            uint32_t id;
            uint8_t score;
            struct Student *partner; // You have to use a pointer to avoid making an "infinite definition"
        } 
        struct Student joe, mary;
        joe.id = 123;
        joe.score = 75;
        joe.partner = &mary;
    Bandwidth (in the context of UART)
        UART- Baud Rate
            setting bit time (delta T)
        Structure of a communication frame
        STX, END, 8-bit payload
        Bandwidth = useful num of bits  * baud rate; 10 total number of bits
    Fifo
        Circulaar queue
            Ensure that any modicfications to the pointers are modded so you stay in the fifo
            Be sure to disable interrupts for the line of code where you edit a globa variable (i.e. the count variable) 

What to Expect when you're EEing
--------------------------------
    - No memorization, but some lookup in addendum
    - No NZVC bits
        Overflow on arithmetic is not on exam
    - FSM will be on the test (both Moore AND Mealy)
    - Linkage (ASM to C and vice versa), AAPCS Convention
    - Local Variables in ASM
