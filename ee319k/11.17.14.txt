===============

Possible software FIFO solutions
    Use global counter, but make it thread safe by making it a CRITICAL SECTION
            DisableInterrupts();
            counter++;
            EnableInterrupts();
    GetI/PutI solution never competes for the same resource
        
Lab 10
------
    Goal: Bring it all together 
        - GPIO, external and internal switches, LEDs
        - SysTick timers and at least one other timer
        - DAC (4-bit will do, but can do 6- or 8-bit)
            Take any WAV file and turn it into a raw sample array
        - ADC (use slide pot as a control)
        - LCD (text and graphics)
        - Game Engine
    missing: FSM and UART
        - add multiplayer? UART
        
    Software Concepts
        - 2D Arrays
        - Structs
        - Linked Lists
        - Callback

        Not a lab checkout
        In-class competition (Wed. 12/3)
