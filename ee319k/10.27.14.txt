Review Lab 7 Concepts
    LCD talks to microcontroller through seven pins (SSI/SPI protocol)
    D/C pin: 1/0 (data/command)
        Tells the LCD whether data or a command is being transferred
    DIN - pin through which data is passed
    Serial communication: one bit after another is passed (not writing all 8 bits at once)
    SSIO_SR_R = Status register for LCD
        Bit 4 => 1 is busy, 0 is free
        Bit 1 => TNF bit; 
    SSIO_DR_R = Device register
        Data in this register is put into a shift register, which passes
        data one bit at a time into the DIN pin

Recursion
    Example: n! = n * (n-1)!
    We need the hypothesis and the base case
    1! = 1 <= base case
    
    uint32_t fact(uint8_t n){
        if (n == 1){
            return n;
        } else{
        return (n * fact(n-1));
        }
    }

    ADC
    We're now implementing a slide bar, or potentiometer (variable resistors)
        Linear potentiometer-- as we slide, resistance changes linearly
        Logarithmic potentiometer-- as you can imagine, logarithmic incrase
            Volume is a logarithmic potentiometer (b/c dB is a log scale unit!)
        Ensure that your potentiometer isn't logarithmic!
    
    Now, we're taking an analog value from the potentiometer (0-10kOhms => 0-3.3V)
    ADC - Analog Digital Converter
        Creates a 12-bit digital value between (0, 4095)

    Should display the position in centimeters on the LCD Screen!

    Terminology
        For a graph of voltage vs. time (digitization):
            delta t between samples: time quantization, or sampling rate
            amplitude quantization, or discretizing (12-bit)        

    How frequently should we sample? Answered by the Nyquist Theorem
        Based off the idea that every signal can be expressed as a summation of sinusoids
        These sinusoids are called the "component frequencies"
        Fourier Analysis and Fourier Transform!!!:D:D:D
        for f_max, the frequency of the highest component frequency,
        
                                    Sampling Rate = 2 * f_max
        
        If you violate the Nyquist Theorem, you lose data! Called 'Aliasing'
            'Wagon wheel effect': aliasing is occurring so that a wagon wheel looks like
                   it is going backwards
