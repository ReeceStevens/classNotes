Lab 10
------
**** Proposal for alternate game due by this Friday ****
    Must contain the basic ideas of the labs
    If turn based, is there an AI?
    
    Space Invaders example
        - Sound
        - Graphics
        - Game Engine
    First: Graphics
        48x84 pixels in the Nokia screen
        Origin is the top left of the screen

            +------------------+
            |                  |
            |                  |
            |                  |
            |                  |
            +------------------+
        Game objects are called Sprites (any object that has a graphics context)
            printBMP(x,y,BMPArray,0);
                F-white, 0-black
            Bitmap Arrays
                jpeg and gif are compressed formats-- pixels aren't stored raw
                .bmp is a RAW file format: 24x36 / 2 bytes (four bits per pixel)
                someimage.bmp (standard format)
                offset 18 and 22 (bytes) in a bmp file store the width and height of a particular image
                
            struct state {
                long x,y;
                long life;
                char *image[2];
            }

    Sound
        Make a raw sample of sound
    Game Engine
        Random number generator
            problem: least significant bit is almost cyclical
                try looking at the higher order bytes (they're a lot more random)
                shift the result by 24
        
    Ch. 15 of e-book covers game engine construction
        Edge triggered interrupts for buttons or controls will make your controls more responsive than using 30Hz timer
