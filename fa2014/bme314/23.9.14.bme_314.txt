Stem Cells
	Overview
		Promises and challenges in stem cell differentiation
		Guidig stem cell differentiation
		Microfluidic approach for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)
	Embryonic Stem Cells
		Forms all three germ layers
			Ectoderm
				Skin, neurons 
			Mesoderm
				bone blood blood vessels
 			Endoderm
				vascular tissue
		Promise of ESC
			High self renewal capabilities
				diabetic pancreas can heal itself
				muscular atrophy regrowth
		Guiding ESC differentiation
			Chemical Cues
				growth factors, either adjacent cells or the cell itself				
			Physical Cues
				cell-cell interactions
				cell-matrix interactions
			Differentiation is difficult- chemicals exist in gradients
				differentiation must be clean- only have desired cell type at the end
					most of the time, you've got a mix of undifferentiated, progenital, and differentiated cells
				*****undifferentiated cells in the body form benign cancer****	teratomas
				cells die if just direcly injected in vivo
					must keep cells alive and not be targeted by immune system
				potential of complex tissue reconstruction requires multiple cell types, not just one
	Guiding Stem Cell Differentiation
		creating intracellular microenvironments for in-vivo vascular differentiation
			behavior is different if cells grown on 3d scaffold vs. petri dish
		Project: Reconstruct vascular tissue using embryonic stem cells
			self-organizational properties
			revascularization of ischemic tissue
				usually, blood vessels are not made by the body after embryonic state-- only continue off of existing vessels
			ischemic tissue: artery blockage causes tissue damage
			Two main growth factors in vascular development
				VEGF PDGF- VAscualar endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor
				Idea: take 3d injectable hydrogel containing two different liposomes containing PDGF and VEGF, respectively
					can control release of growth factors
					hyaluronic acid is the hydrogel
						natural polymer, degraded enzymatically by stem cells
					forming liposomes
						difference between two lipids is the melting temperature
						higher mp: 55 c, lower mp: 23 c; lower mp willl release more quickly at room temp
					result: cells DID organize into blood vessels
					positive test in mouse-- injectable blood vessels reconstructed a completely blocked artery in the mouse
		engineering internal microenvironments for non-viral delivery of siRNA
			siRNA- prevents specific genes from being expressed (small interfering RNA)
			used liposomes to contain siRNA
			didn't work in 2D, tried in 3D scaffolds and it worked
			Analsysis via FACS	
			Next gene to test: KDR
		siRNA can be used to control differentiation, but must have an extremely high knockdown (cell acceptance)
	Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
		Taking an adult cell and transforming it back to a stem cell using only four genes
		Potential for no immunity issues b/c therapy can be done with patient's own cells
		Challenges:
			Tumorigenicity and low reprogramming efficiency
			Do IPSs actually behave like stem cells down the line?
		Make the transformation more efficient and safe
			microfluidic delivery
			deliver the proteins directly-- skip the whole translation process
				squeeze cell to form micropores and accept proteins
	Future work
		ips can be transferred back further, even before germ layer formation- naive stem cells
