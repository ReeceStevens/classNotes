# EE 461S Lecture -- 11.10.16

## Quiz :'(

## Different Concurrency Bugs

- Atomicity violations

    - Serializability (processes or blocks of code should be atomically 
      completed)

- Order violations

**TODO**: Check out the concurrency bugs paper that Dr. Y showed us in class

## Next topic: Persistence

Third step in the OSTEP book

For our purposes: persistence involves data that is saved in non-volatile memory

- This boils down to *filesystems*

    - Hard disk

    - flash memory

What's the device driver for an I/O device?

System architecture:

```
    CPU         Memory
     |              |
<=========================> Memory Bus
            |
            |
            |
<=========================> General IO Bus
            |
            |
            |
<=========================> Peripheral bus (SATA, USB, etc)

```
Speed decreases as you move down and is a fcn of length and width of bus

Interacting with a device:

- Polling

- Interrupts

- DMA

Most OS's and systems want to develop a uniform interface with external devices

- Each device has a driver

    - Provides a unform interface that hides the structural aspects of the
      device

- Each driver interacts through the filesystem

## How a hard drive works

Splatter (aluminum coated magnetic surface)

- Tracks

    - Sectors (unit of memory transfer)

There is one read/write head per splatter

- Splatter is always rotating at a constant speed `R`

    - Average rotational delay is `R/2`

- Seek time

    - A significant delay that comes from the movement of the RW head from
      track to track

    - 4 steps

        - accelerate

        - coast

        - deccelerate

        - settling time
