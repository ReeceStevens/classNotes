## Scheduling (cont'd)

***Look this section up in the book, came in late today***

### Stride Scheduling

- Does not depend on an RNG

- Achieves fairness more deterministically

- Choose the task with the least pass value to run for time `ts`

## Virtual Memory

- *Scheduling* is a mechanism of *CPU* virtualization

- Memory virtualization

    - Illusion that a process has access to an order of magnitude more memory
      than the physical memory

    - Achieved by the concept of virtual memory

- Address Space (abstraction)

```
Memory layout of a process vs. a program

         0x0000 ---------
                |       | code
                |       |
                |-------| --
                | init  |  |
                |-------|  | -- heap
                |  un - |  |
                |  init |  |
                |-------| --
                |       | stack
         0xffff ---------

Assume the physical memory is only 256B!
```

To manage fitting a big footprint into a small space, we break memory into:

- Chunks (assume 16 bytes)

    - Pages (virtual address space)

    - Frames (physical address space)

Break the memory into 16-byte chunks and only map a subset of program memory
into physical memory at any one time.

Requires keeping track of these mappings! Introduces the concept of Per Process
Mapping (--> page table)

### Virtual memory in early systems

```
virtual address --> physical address

```

- Could be done in software (static allocation) <-- loader

- Done in hardware (dynamic allocation)

```
Process                 Phys Memory
  0 ---------                 0 ---------
    |       |                   |       |
    |       |                   |       |
    |       |(not to scale) 40kB|-------|
    |       | ----------------> |       | 16kB
    |       |                   |-------|
    |       |                   |       |
16kB---------               64kB---------

Base Register: 40kB

virtual address 128B maps to 40kB+128B

```

How do you check for validity? Need something called a *bounds register*.

    bounds reg: 16kB (limit of valid virtual address)

### Taking it one step further: Segmentation

Non-monolithic address space! i.e., broken into segments.

- Code segment

- Heap segment

- Stack segment

```
virtual address space
    ---------
    | code  |
    |-------|
    | heap  |       maintain per-segment state (base + bounds + grow_direction)
    |-------|
    |       |
    | empty |
    |       |
    |       |
    |-------|
    | stack |
    |       |
    ---------

```

### Address Translation

In pintos, we use paging but no segmentation

32-bit virtual address

```
    -----------------------------
    |     page no     |   offset|
    ---------------|-------------
        20 bits    |    12 bits
                   |
                   |----> page table (per process)      Physical memory
                                --------------     -----------------
                                |frameno| |  | --> | frameno|offset|
                                --------------     -----------------
                                         D P

                                D = dirty bit
                                P = Present bit
```

Since code has locality, you should only load the portions of code that you
need

Currently in Pintos (as of project 2), the entire program is loaded (see
implementation of `load` in `start_process`. First goal of project 3: *lazy
loading.*

What do you do if there's no more free space in physical memory? Have to choose
a chunk to remove from memory. That's the next significant portion of lab 3

- *Page replacement policy*

    - Random

    - Least recently used

- When a page is "evicted", you write it to a region of the disk called "swap".

    - *Swap space management*
