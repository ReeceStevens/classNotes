## From Last Time: Scheduling

Two metrics of success:

1. Turnaround time

    - Shortest job first (SJF) (no preemption)

    - shortest completion time first (SCTF) (preemption)

2. Response time

    - Round Robin scheduler

3. Jitter (not in the scope of this class)

A good scheduling algorithm can give you good metrics for both 1 and 2

## Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

Algorithm that tries to learn from past behavior to make decisions

Five rules:

***Rule 1:*** `if (Pri(x) > Pri(y)), x gets scheduled.`

***Rule 2:*** `if (Pri(x) == Pri(y)), round-robin them`

```
                ---------
     Highest -> | Q6    | --> A --> C
                ---------
                | Q5    |
                ---------
                | Q4    |
                ---------
                | Q3    | --> B
                ---------
                | Q2    |
                ---------
                | Q1    | --> D
                ---------
     Lowest ->  | Q0    | --> F --> E
                ---------

    Highest priority ready task runs!

```

How are programs assigned priority levels?

- *The MLFQ is useless if program priority levels don't change!*

- Needs to be a way to change priority level during the lifetime of a process.

***Rule 3:*** A new task always enters at highest priority

***Rule 4a:*** If a task uses up its time slice at level n, then it gets
               demoted to level n-1.

***Rule 4b:*** If a task gives up the CPU before its time slice ends (i.e. 
               it performs io), let it remain at its current level.

Example:

- 3 tasks: `a`, `b`, and `c`

- All have runtime of 100 ms, no I/O

```
    ---------
    |  L2   | --> A --> B --> C
    ---------                      Timeline (no I/O)
    |  L1   |                  |            
    ---------                  | A | B | C | A | B | C |...
    |  L0   |               ---|-----------|-----------|-----
    ---------                  |   L2      |    L1     | L0
```

- Now let's say `A` is interactive and `B`, `C` are CPU-bound

```
    ---------
    |  L2   | --> A --> B --> C
    ---------                      Timeline (A has I/O, 1ms fired after 5ms)
    |  L1   |                  |5  20  20 5 1 5 1 5
    ---------                  |A| B | C |A|B|A|C|A|...
    |  L0   |               ---|-----------------------------
    ---------                  |   L2           L1
```

### Issues with this approach

1. Starvation

    - You can get trapped at the lowest level

2. Gaming

    - If you want to game the system, yield right at the very end of your timeslice

    - Keeps you at the top of the priority queue

3. Static

    - Assumes that behavior is static. No room for change in behavior

    - i.e. what if a bottom-level process suddenly becomes an interactive process?

In response to these problems, we have:

***Rule 5***: Reset, or Priority Boost Rule

- Periodically reset the priority levels after some `s` time units

- All tasks start again at the highest priority level

- No starvation problem, makes scheduling dynamic

- Still can't solve gaming the system

***Rule 6***: True Accounting

- Keep track of accumulated time towards time slice

- Lower level when accumulated time exceeds time slice

### Interesting Note

Voodoo Constants (nobody knows what the best value is)

- Parameterization; every scheduling algorithm has parameters you can tweak to
  optimize behavior

    - number of queues

    - Time slice `T_s`

    - Reset for priority boost `s`

- Ex: Solaris says "we don't know what's best, you can configure it for yourself"

Possible modifications

1. Timeslice can be different for different levels (per-level timeslice)

    - Higher priority gets bigger `T_s` (for batch systems, opposite for interactive systems)

    - Lower priority gets lower `T_s` (for batch systems, opposite for interactive systems)

2. More complex priority selection (heuristics)

    - consider CPU time and IO mix

## Proportional Share Algorithms

Basis is in the idea of *tickets*

- Every task is assigned a number of tickets based on importance (applies to both algos)

- Scheduler holds a lottery every "so often" (e.g. every time slice) (applies to lotto)

- Random number generator (applies to lotto)

### Lottery Scheduling

- Achieve fairness over a long period of time

```

Task    Tickets
----    -------
 A        75
 B        25

Total tickets = 100; RNG produces number in [0, 99]

```

- Implementation

```
    A ----> B ----> C
   (100)   (50)   (250)

Can optimize by keeping list sorted by decreasing order of ticket count.
```

### Stride Scheduling

- Achieve fairness at all times
