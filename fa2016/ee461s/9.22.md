# EE 461S Lecture -- 9.22.16

## Quiz (yikes!)

## Project 2

Suggested order of implementation only covers how to *start* the project.

## Agenda for Today

- Proper development environment setup

- Proper development process

## Debugging in Pintos

1. Launch the OS

2. Inside the qemu emulation:

    - Create the GDB shell

3. Outside the qemu emulation:

    - Run GDB and connect with the TCP socket (default is port 1234)

    - Send commands over the remote socket to the emulator

    - On your machine, run `pintos-gdb kernel.o` inside the build directory

    In GDB:

        ```
        target remote localhost:1234
        break syscall.c:syscall_handler
        ```

    There also are some GDB macros that pintos has (like `debugpintos` 
    or something like that)

Supply the `--gdb` option on the `pintos` compile command

## Visual interface for GDB

`ddd` is a visual interface for gdb.

`ddd -gdb -debugger pintos-gdb kernel.o`

## Pintos Built-In Data Structures

You need to understand these, because you'll have to use them eventually!

- Linked list (doubly-linked) (see `/home/reece/school/os/listDemo/list_use.c`)

    - Examples: children list, ready-list, all-list

    - Has a `list_sort()` function and a `list_entry()` function

- Hash table

    - Examples: list of open files (Dr. Y says he used a linked list for this one tho)

## Synchronization

- Mutual exclusion

- Ordering

    - If I have two threads and want to impose an order on them: A -> B

        i.e. A should always be run before B

        solution: use semaphore!

        ```c
        struct semaphore order;
        sema_init(&order, 0);

        process_A();
        sema_up(&order)
        // ...waiting around ...
        sema_down(&order)
        process_B();
        ```
