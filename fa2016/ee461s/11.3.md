## Last Time: Condition Variables

## Picking up where we left off: Producer/consumer problem

Lessons learned:

- For single producer and consumer, a buffer of size 1 and an `if` statement
  will do just fine

- For multiple producers and consumers, `if` must be changed to `while`

- Also, need to ensure that consumers only wake up producers and vice versa

Next solution: Two condition variables.

```c
cont_t empty, fill;
mutex_t mutex;

void* producer(void* arg) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        while(count == 1) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&empty, &mutex);
        }
        put(i);
        pthread_cond_signal(&fill);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    }
}

void* consumer(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < loops; i ++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        while(count == 0)
            pthread_cond_wait(&fill, &mutex)
        int tmp = get();
        pthread_cond_signal(&empty);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
        printf("%d\n", tmp);
    }
}
```

Things to note about the above solution:

- Producers wait on empty and signal fill

- Consumers wait on fill and signal empty

These conditions ensure producers only wake up producers and vice versa.

These involve *Mesa semantics*, where a single thread is woken up by `wait` but
there is no guarantee it will be the thread that runs

Another alternative solution is the *covering condition*, where you broadcast
the wake up after `wait` to all threads.

### POSIX Semaphore

- POSIX semaphore: a variable set to an initial value on which two operations
  are possible:

    - `sema_wait`

    - `sema_post`

- In the posix implementation, the value of the semaphore is the number of
  threads waiting

### Contrast: Condition variable

```c
sem_t s;
void* child(void* args) {
    printf("child\n");
    return NULL;
}

int main(){
    int x = 0; // X must be zero in order for the parent to wait for child
    sema_init(&s, 0,x); // What value should the sema take initially?
    printf("parent: begin\n");
    pthread_t c;
    pthread_create(&c, NULL, child, NULL);
    printf("parent: end\n");
}
```

### Solution to producer/consumer using semaphores

People use this implementation instead of condition variables since pthreads
isn't ported to all systems

### Deadlock

A situation where the entire system is excluded from making progress
