# EE 461L Lecture -- 9.15.16

## Announements

- Project 2 will be through GitHub (check Canvas for the URL)

- Looks like from this point on, the projects will be in groups.

## Project 2

Goals of the project:

- Provide file system accesses

    - You don't have to modify the filesystem, just know how to read from it.

    - `pintos_mkdisk filesys.disk --filesys-size=2`

    - Can hold up to 16 files (no more)

    - `pintos -f -q` formats the disk into a filesystem

    - *bottom line: all files are contiguously allocated.*

        - for a read, all you need to know is the initial file location. No
          mapping to inode tables!

- Manages "processes"

- Setup an address space for each process

- Pass arguments

- Provide system calls

Within filesystem, 

- `/userprog`

- `/vm`

- `/threads`

- `/filesys`

## Process vs. Thread

A thread is a context within which a process runs. Every process in pintos has
one thread. Because of this, "thread" and "process" are used somewhat
interchangeably.

Process control block (PCB) is equivalent to a `struct thread`, and `pid ==
thread_id`. This struct is in `thread.h`.

In this file, implement a table with every open file for a process.

1. Kernel threads

    - We won't be worrying about these in project 2

2. User threads

## File systems

- No internal synchronization

- File size is fixed at creation time

See slideshow for file system overview and useful utilities for building the
filesystem.

Every program will make at least one syscall-- exit!

Project 2 is all about implementing the filesystem's syscalls

## Process Address Space

*** Note to self-- read over this chapter in the book. Not clear on the
concepts!***

### Invalid Access

- Kernel space

- Non-mapped (not present) pages

- Incorrect permissions

    - i.e. can't write to code segment
