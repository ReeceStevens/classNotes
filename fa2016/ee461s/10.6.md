    |mov 117, eax|       =====>          |process|
    |            |                       |-------|
    |            |                       |       |

### Version 1: Monolithic address space mapped to physical memory

1. Software Mapping

    - Every command that moves to a certain address is rewritten to 
      have the address plus the physical memory offset

2. Hardware mapping

    - Every address operation has a translation step that adds the address

    - `base + virtual address = physical address`

    - big advantage: relocation is super easy! Just change the base offset

### Version 2: Segmentation

- Break the program up into different segements (heap, stack, code)

- Three different base registers for the three different segments

    - Also have a bounds register to make sure addresses are valid

```
Process Address Space               Physical Memory

    --------------                       ---------
    |            |                       |       |
    |            |                       |       |
    |            |                       |       |
    |mov 117, eax|       =====>          |       |
    |            |                       |       |
    |            |                       |       |
    |            |                       |       |
    --------------                       ---------

Segment     Base    Size        Grows Positive?     Protection
---------------------------------------------------------------
Code        32K     2K          1                   Read-Execute
Heap        34K     2K          1                   Read-Write
Stack       28K     2K          0                   Read-Write
```

- Size is not static! Size really acts as your bound.

- Big problem: if your stack segment is right against another program boundary,
  you have to move the *entire* stack to another location in memory. Very painful.

### Version 3: Paging

- Break up virtual address space into pages, physical address space into frames

- Need a mapping from each page to each frame. Result: a Page Table.

    - Page table maps page number to frame number

```
Virtual Address
        32-bit

|____20_______|____12____|
32  page no      offset  0

    2^20 pages

Page table
    2^20 entries
-------------
|           |
|-----------|
|      |    | ----> |_frame__|_oft_|
|-----------|
|           |
-------------
```

Because this mapping must be done at every single memory access, it should be
done in hardware

- MMU, memory management unit

- Keeps a single page table

    - Each process believes it has its own page table

    - Managed by a system level Page Table Base Register

        - On context switch, the base register is changed to the program page table

```
Per-process Page Table

-------------
| pageno | 1| <--- present bit (1/0) is at bit 0
|           |
|           |
|           |
-------------
```

- When the hardware performs the translatioN:

    ```
        if (PT[pageno] bit 0 is 0) {
            // invalid access
            page_fault();
        } else {
            // valid
        }
    ```

Possible reasons for page fault:

- Page of code not loaded yet

    - OS loads page

        - Find free frame

        - copy page contents from disk to frame

```
Frame Table
|pointer_to_owner|_A_|
```
```c
const void* frameTable;
void find_free_frame(void) {
   // Iterate through table
   // Find entry with A == 0
   // Or ptr is null.
   if (none exists) {
     evict one frame
     // Update the process that was mapped to that frame
     // so that it knows it isn't mapped anymore.
     // Also, maintain if the data was modified (the "Dirty bit")
     // If dirty, write to disk
   }
}
```

Eviction policies

- Random

- Least recently used

Page Table Entry

- Should be one word (4 bytes)

```

|__frame_no___|_|_____|A|D|P|
    20 bits    3

    A = accessed
    D = dirty
    P = present 
```

To keep track of all of this, the OS has a supplimental page table

in x86,

```

|_PD_NUM |___PT num___|___offset____|

```

`2^20` entries with 4 bytes per entry. This means the page table size is 4 MB!

- Will not fit in one page (in x86, page size is 4kB)
