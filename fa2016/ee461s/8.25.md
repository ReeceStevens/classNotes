# EE 461S Lecture -- 8.15.16

## Syllabus Breakdown
Textbook: OSTEP
    Textbook required, just get the $10 PDF version

Projects (5):
    - 1st: on Linux shell
    - 2nd-5th: on Pintos
        - Implementing components of an operating system

    Pintos is module-oriented. Writes in x86
        Used in addition with bochs and qemu (x86 emulators)
        - this is useful for yerraballi, he has test cases to run
          and the emulator boots very quickly

No homeworks in the class. Instead, quiz every other week.
    - Not designed to be tricky, you just need to read the material or take
      good notes.

Two Exams, 40% total

## What is an OS?
What does it do?
    - manages hardware resources
    - allows multiple programs to run simultaneously
    - abstracts away the hardware and provide a simple API (system call API)
    - collection of "device drivers"

Three dimensions:
    - Virtualization
        The program/process believes it has the hardware all to itself
        The program/process beleives it has the entire memory (virtual memory)
    - Concurrency
        Process can be run in multiple threads
        Concurrency in time and space
            i.e. can execute at the "same time"
            AND  can access the same memory location at the same time
    - Persistence

POSIX standard
    - Support a certain set of calls
    - enforces portable code
    - unfortunately, there's wiggle room (hence different syscall behavior on
      Windows vs. OSX or Linux)

### Example of virtualization
```
// cpu.c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    while(1) {
        printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    }
}
```

```
$ gcc -o cpu cpu.c
$ ./cpu a // prints "a", "a", "a" forever
$ ./cpu A & ./cpu B & ./cpu C // fork processes to background
```

Program vs. Process
    - Program is an executable, static entity
    - Once it is run, it runs within a process
        - Process has:
            - static Image (code)
            - any initialized variables
            - stack (local vars, function params)
            - heap (dynamic allocation (malloc, calloc, etc))



```
// mem.c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int *p;
    p = malloc(sizeof(int));
    // %p prints the address
    // of a give pointer. That's pretty cool!
    printf("pid: %d, addr of p: %p\n", get_pid(), p);
    *p = atoi(argv[1]);
    while(1) {
        *p = *p + 1;
        printf("pid: %d, addr of p: %p\n", get_pid(), p);
    }
}
```
```
$ gcc -o mem mem.c
$ ./mem 100
$ ./mem 100 & ./mem 100 & ./mem 100 // fork processes to background
```

### Example of concurrency
```
//threads.c
#include <pthread.h>
int loops;
int counter = 0;

void* worker(void *arg) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < loops; i ++) {
        counter++; // this is a non-atomic operation
    }
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main (int argc, char **argv){
    loops = atoi(argv[1]);
    pthread_t p1, p2;
    pthread_create(&p1, NULL, worker, NULL);
    pthread_create(&p2, NULL, worker, NULL);
    pthread_join(&p1);
    pthread_join(&p2);
    printf("%d\n",counter);

}
```

```
$ gcc -o threads threads.c -lpthreads
$ ./threads 2000 // 4000
```

Note here on `pthread_create`:
    `worker` is a subroutine. Only subroutines returning a `void*` pointer can
    be elevated to the status of a thread.
Note on `pthread_join`:
    this is called reaping the exit status of the child.

For sufficiently high argument numbers, you'll start getting race conditions
because the threads are interrupting each other mid-update (lost update).
    - OS must provide ways to prevent this from happening. Semaphores, locks,
      etc.
