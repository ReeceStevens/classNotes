## Last Time

Locks

```c
typedef struct {
    int flag; // 0 is available, 1 is held
} lock_t;

void lock_init(lock_t* lock) {
    lock->flag = 0;
}

void lock(lock_t* l) {
    // This fails b/c it's not atomic.
    while(lock->flag == 1) {}
    lock->flag = 1;
}

void unlock(lock_t* l) {
    lock->flag = 0;
}

```

- Solution to this problem: a hardware instruction for "test and set"

```c
// Test and set strategy
int test_and_set(int* oldptr, int new) {
    int old = *oldptr;
    *oldptr = new;
    return old;
}
```

- Leads us to the correct lock implementation:

```c
void lock(lock_t* l) {
    while(test_and_set(&lock->flag, 1) == 1) {}
}
```

Alternatives to test-and-set: Compare and swap, fetch and add

```c
// Compare and swap implementation (CnS)
int CnS(int *ptr, int expected, int new) {
    int actual = *ptr;
    if (actual == expected)
        *ptr = new
    return actual;
}

void lock(lock_t* l) {
    while(CnS(&lock->flag,0,1) == 1)) {}
}
```

Both test-and-set and compare-and-swap have a pretty big problem.

Evaluating locks:

1. Correctness: does it provide mutual exclusion?

2. Fairness: Guarantee a waiting thread progress

3. Performance: Is this time efficient?

While both TES and CNS score okay on 1, ***they perform poorly on fairness***.

    ```c
    void lock(lock_t* l) {
        while(TnS(&lock->flag,1) == 1) {}
    }

    ```

    - Assume we have two threads, A and B.

        - If both have the same path of execution,then A can get the lock an
          indefinite number of times before B gets the lock

    - A more fair solutoin would be turn-based

Fetch and add system

    ```c
    int fetch_and_add(int* ptr) {
        int old = *ptr;
        *ptr = old++;
        return old;
    }

    typedef struct {
        int ticket;
        int turn;
    } lock_t;

    void lock_init(lock_t* l) {
        l->ticket = 0;
        l->turn = 0;
    }

    void lock(lock_t* l) {
        int myturn = fetch_and_add(&l->ticket);
        while(l->turn != myturn) {}
    }

    void unlock(lock_t* l) {
        fetch_and_add(&l->turn);
    }
    ```

To solve performance issues, you can do

```c
lock(lock_t* l) {
    while(TnS(&l->flag, 1) == 1) {
        yield(); // Yield control back to kernel, don't waste the timeslice
    }
}
```

Alternate solution: can we create a queue of waiting threads on a resource?
That way we can guarantee first-come-first serve

```c
typedef struct {
    int flag;
    int guard;
    queue_t* q; // Some queue data structure
} lock_t;

void lock(lock_t* m) {
    while(TnS(&m->guard,1) == 1) {}
    if (m->flag == 0) {
        m->flag = 1;
        m->guard = 0;
    } else {
        queue_add(m->q, get_tid()); // Somebody else has flag
        m->guard = 0;
        park();

        // Order of m->guard and park() is important here
    }
}

void unlock(lock_t* m) {
    while(TnS(&m->guard, 1) == 1) {}
    if (queue_empty(m->q)) {
        m->flag = 0;
    } else {
        unpark(queue_remove(m->q));
        m->guard = 0;
    }
}
```

- Advantage of this solution: spin statements limited to just the guard
  (efficient)

## Thread Safety

Threadsafe: A thread safe function is one that can be safely called from
multiple threads at the same time.

    - "Safely" means it will deliver the same functionality regardless of how
      many threads access it.
