## Last Time

Fast File System (FFS) was the turning point in FS development

- Previous fs on UNIX performed really badly

    - Internal fragmentation (space inefficiency)

    - Disk unaware (fs doesn't know geometry of disk) (time inefficiency)

        - Long seek times

- FFS brought disk awareness

    - added heuristics based on common sense and some empirical studies

    - Focused on average size and access patterns

- Used a structure called a "cylinder group"

```
    Cylinder Group
    ---------------------------------
    | SB | Group 1 | Group 2 | ...  |
    ---------------------------------
            |
            |
            V       individual group
    ----------------------------------
    |superblock|i-bmap|d-bmap| blocks|
    ----------------------------------

    The same track on each platter forms a cylinder group
```

- Heuristic rules

    1. When picking placement of directories, choose a cylinder group with
       low number of directories and high number of inodes

        - You want to optimize for directory growth

    2. When picking placment of files:

        - Allocate inode and data blocks in the same cylinder group

        - Allocate the file's inode + blocks in the group where its
          enclosing directory is

        - Large file exception: only the inode and direct pointer data blocks
          are stored in the same cylinder group. Indirect blocks can be stored
          in a separate cylinder group.

- Locality of Access (file/directory level)

    - Metric: Distance to the nearest ancestor

- Minimize seeks between transfers

    - Amortization: get the most that you can every time you have to pay the
      overhead of an access

    - Example: avg positioning time: 10ms, disk transfer rate: 40 MB/s

        - Say desired bandwidth is 50% of peak: 1/2 time seeking, 1/2 time in
          transfer

        - 10 ms of seeking, 10 ms of data transfer

- Other FFS innovations

    - sub-blocks: there are a *lot* of small (<2kB) files. don't grab a full
      4kB block for all of them.

    - Disk layout (skipped sectors to account for the disk arm movement during
      transfer)

    - Longer filenames (no longer an 8 character limit)

    - Symbolic links

    - Atomic rename operation

## Persistence

A big part of persistance is *crash recovery*

Workload: append a single data block to an existing file

3 Steps:

1. Update the inode

2. Modify the data block

3. Update the data bitmap
