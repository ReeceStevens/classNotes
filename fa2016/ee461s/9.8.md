## Last Class: Limited Direct Execution

A mechanism by which an OS application or process run, but not with complete
control over the hardware.

We want to implement a *down call* from the application layer down into the
operating system (i.e., the system call). This is contrasted with a *lateral
call* such as a call to a library function.

Solution for this: ***Modes of Execution***

1. User mode (unprivileged mode)

    - Limited memory access

    - Limited device access (since devices are memory mapped, it's limited
      memory access too)

    - Instruction limits

        - Example: Users can't do a return from `TRAP`

2. Supervisor mode (privileged mode, kernel mode)


## Switch between Kernel Mode and User Mode

The switch between user mode and kernel mode is considered the "syscall
overhead". Important metric of comparison between OSs

```
    OS (at boot): initialize trap table

    Hardware: remembers address of syscall handlers

    OS (kernel mode): Create pcblist
    OS (kernel mode): allocate memory for program
    OS (kernel mode): load program into memory
    OS (kernel mode): setup *user stack* with argv
        In C, inputs to a function come on the user stack
    OS (kernel mode): fill *kernel stack* with reg/PC
        5 registers in the kernel stack (ebx, ebp, esi, edi, eax)
        At first, all of these are zero
        PC has address of main
    OS (kernel mode): perform return-from-trap

    Hardware: restore regs from kernel stack
    Hardware: move to user mode
    Hardware: jump to main

    Program (user mode): run main()
    Program (user mode): call system call

    Program (user mode): trap into OS

    Hardware: save regs to kernel stack
    Hardware: move to kernel mode
    Hardware: jump to trap handler

    OS (kernel mode): handle trap
    OS (kernel mode): do work of syscall
    OS (kernel mode): perform return-from-trap

    Hardware: restore regs from kernel stack
    Hardware: move to user mode
    Hardware: jump to PC after trap 

    Program (user mode): continue...
    Program (user mode): return from main()
    Program (user mode): trap (via exit())

    OS (kernel mode):  free memory of process
    OS (kernel mode):  remove from process list
```

### Cooperative scheduling

- Mac OS did this before OSX!!! lol that's bad

- OS doesn't regain control until a syscall occurs

- Syscall triggers scheduling, or an explicit yield

    - Syscall `yield`

- counts on programs being "nice" (eventually yielding to the OS)

### Real Scheduler

- Needs a timer

- Not only is there a syscall handler, but also a timer handler

- Interrupt timer interrupts the CPU every x milliseconds (i.e. the
  "timeslice")

    - Context switch!

    - OS return to kernel mode after that interrupt

```
User: Process A...

Hardware: timer interrupt
Hardware: save registers from process A to kernel stack A
Hardware: move to kernel mode
Hardware: jump to timer handler

OS (kernel mode): Handle the trap
OS (kernel mode): call switch() routine
    OS (kernel mode): save registers of A to process struct A (pcb) ---|
    OS (kernel mode): Restore regs B from process struct B             |- context switch
    OS (kernel mode): switch to kernel stack B                      ---|
OS (kernel mode): return-from-trap into process B

Hardware: restore regs B from k-stack B
Hardware: move to user mode
Hardware: jump into process B's PC

User: Process B...
```

## PintOS

There is no `fork` followed by `exec`

- It is merged into a single `exec` call

Dr. Kim's resource page on Canvas is the best resource for setting up pintos
