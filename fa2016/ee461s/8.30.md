# EE 461S Lecture -- 8.30.16

Take a deeper dive into OS concepts we need for the first lab!

## Review

Applications don't touch the hardware

    - The OS surrounds the hardware, exposes an API in the form of system calls
      so that applications can use hardware resources

    - Provides the concept of *isolation*-- applications won't interrupt or 
      step on each other (application "sandboxing")

Lab 1 is focused on understanding the system call API.

## System Calls

When an OS starts:

```
init(1)
  |__ other process
  |__ other process
  |__ ...etc
  |__ daemon (any service that runs in the background)
    |__ crond (example of a daemon)
    |__ syslogd (typically the trailing "d" indicates a service)
    |__ mdm
      |__ Xorg
      |__ window manager (i.e. cinnamon, awesome, etc.)
        |__ Firefox
        |__ word processing
        |__ etc.
```

Every process has a process id (`pid`). The `init` process has a `pid`
of 1.

A *daemon* is any service that runs in the background

### What is a process?

*Process*: A program in a state of execution

```
   ________         ________
   |  cpu |         |memory|
   |      |         |      |
   --------         --------
      |               |
---------------------------------
            |
        -----------
        |  disk   |
        |         |
        |(program)| ----------------|
        |         |                 |

|status                                  |
|Register state                          |
|PC (instruction pointer, IP)            |
|SP, FP (stack pointer, frame pointer)   |
|List of open resources                  |
|    (files, sockets, networks, devices) |
|----------------------------------------|
```
A scheduler has a list of pcbs and controls when they execute

### Lifecycle of a process
```
            schedule
            --------->
---> ready              running
      ^     <--------       |
      |     deschedule      | I/O request
      |                     v
      |----------------- blocked
            I/O complete
```

A large part of this class will be scheduling polices

Other possible states that can exist:

    - zombie state: child process whose parent has exited

    - term state: temp state after which the program is terminated

See what state the processes on your machine are by running `ps` or `pstree`

Process communication: pipes, signals

Process I/O: standard in/out, files

### Process Creation

Process creation is centered around the system call `fork()`.

```c
// p1.c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    int id;
    id = fork(); // system call!
}
```
