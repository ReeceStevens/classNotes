## Disk Schedulers

Work-conserving disk scheduler

- Wait a little bit to improve overall performance

In old OS's, old disk drivers didn't do caching or scheduling. Disk scheduling
was the responsibility of the OS

- Were doing "shortest job first" (really, shortest access first)

- dominant algorithm: Shortest Seek Time first

    - Downside: ignores rotation

    - Can cause starvation

Newer hard drives

- Disk scheduling and buffer caching done in firmware

- OS simply batches requests and sends them to the disk

- Dominant algorithms: SCAN algorithms

    - Move the arm from innermost track to outermost track ("elevator" algo)

    - F-SCAN

        - Freezes the batch of sectors it's supposed to be looking for until it
          completes the requests.

    - C-SCAN

        - Circular scan

- Shortest positioning Time first

    - Takes into account both seek and rotation

- Most come with "write-through", "write-behind" capability to bypass the
  buffer

## Filesystem Implementation

File system use: Done through syscalls like `open`, `create`, `read`, `write`

- Some new ones: `link`, `unlink`, `rename`, `mkdir`

- Types:

    - Regular file

    - Directory

    - Link

Every file on the disk in the filesystem has a unique id: the **inode**

- "Index node" points to all info about a file

    - Data

    - Metadata

- Linking

    - Hard links (i.e. "short cuts")

        - Hard links don't span across filesystems

        - this is because inodes are only unique in its own filesystem. They
          don't have any meaning outside the scope of the filesystem

    - Symbolic links

        - they are actually fully-fledged files that represent links

        - Basically stores the full path to the next file
