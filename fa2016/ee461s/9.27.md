# EE 461S Lecture -- 9.27.16

## Project 1

ROX tests are counterintuitive, you should read the test cases

- They depend on writing to an executable page (should never be okay)

## Today: Scheduling

Workload characterizations

- Does a process run to completion?

- Do I know its time of execution?

- Does it perform I/O?

Scheduling assumptions:

1. Each job runs for the same amount of time

    - `t_i_exec == t_j_exec for all i,j; i,j in the range of (0, n-1)`

2. All jobs arrive at the same time

    - `t_i_arr = t_j_arr for all i,j`

3. All jobs run to completion

    - A job cannot be interrupted

4. All jobs only use the CPU

    - No I/O in job profile

5. Assume the runtime of each job is known

    - `t_i_exec is known for all i`

Scheduler: decides the order of execution of jobs

- Which job runs next?

- How do you define a "good" scheduling algorithm?

    - Performance metric / scheduling metric

        - turnaround time `T_turnaround = t_completion - t_arrival`

            - Specifically: *average* turnaround time!

        - Optimium: `T_turnaround = t_exec`

- Example:

```
    T_exec  T_arr
    ---------------  First strategy: FIFO
  A  10      0          T_turnaround = (10 + 20 + 30) / 3 = 20
  B  10      0
  C  10      0
```

### Relax assumption 1: Unequal execution times

```
    T_exec  T_arr
    ---------------  First strategy: FIFO
  A  100     0          T_turnaround = (100 + 110 + 120) / 3 = 110
  B  10      0
  C  10      0
```

A way to optimize turnaround time would be to prioritize shorter jobs:

- Shortest Job First

    - Pick the shortest (`t_exec`) among ready jobs

        ```
            T_exec  T_arr
            ---------------  First strategy: SJF
          A  100     0          T_turnaround = (10 + 20 + 120) / 3 = 500
          B  10      0
          C  10      0
        ```
    - If all jobs arrive at the same time *and* their exec times are not equal,
      the best scheduling algorithm w.r.t. `t_turnaround` is SJF

### Relax assumption 2: Unequal Arrivals

```
    T_exec  T_arr
    ---------------  First strategy: SJF
  A  100     0          T_turnaround = (100 + 100 + 110) / 3 = 103.3
  B  10     10
  C  10     10
```

This isn't very effective. We want to relax assumtpion 3 as well-- that way we can
suspend process A!

### Relax assumption 3: Preepmtion

- Optimium: shortest time to completion first (STCF)

```
    T_exec  T_arr
    ---------------  First strategy: STCF
  A  100     0          T_turnaround = (120 + 10 + 20) / 3 = 50
  B  10     10
  C  10     10       10  10  10   90
                    | A | B | C | A     |
                    -----------------------
                        ^
                      preempted
```

STCF is optimal when:

1. Unequal arrivals and execution times

2. Preemptible

### Cost of Context Switching

When we preempt or switch contexs, there is a non-trivial amount of overhead.

Generally though, it's small with respect to execution time

### Metrics

In batch systems, only one metric: turnaround time.

In interactive systems, however, turnaround time is a bad metric.

    - Better metric for interactive systems: response time.

    - Def: `t_response = t_first_run - t_arrive`. Measure of interactivity

    ```
        T_exec  T_arr
        ---------------  First strategy: STCF
      A  100     0          T_response = (0 + 0 + 10) / 3 = 3.3
      B  10     10
      C  10     10       10  10  10   90
                        | A | B | C | A     |
                        -----------------------
                            ^
                          preempted
    ```

    - STCF isn't that great for response time. Better idea: round robin scheduler

        - time slicing; taking turns in units of a time slice

            - `t_s` should always be a multiple of the timer interrupt

    ```
        T_exec  T_arr
        ---------------  First strategy: Round Robin, ts = 10ms
      A   5      0          T_response = (0 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 1
      B   5      0
      C   5      0           10  10  10   90
       (units: seconds)     |A|B|C|A|B|C|A|B|C...
                            -----------------------
                                ^
                            preempted
    ```
        - Caution: if `ts` too small, Context switch overhead becomes very significant

            - if `ts` is too big, it's not a significant algorithm
