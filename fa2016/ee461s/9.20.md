# EE 461S Lecture -- 9.20.16

## Announcements

- Private repo issue (just clone it)

- Quiz on Thursday (Ch. 6 and Pintos intro)

## Agenda

- Details on the Pintos `userprog` project

    - Stanford docs

    - SKKU slides

- Begin looking at Scheduling

## Process API and System Calls

- Process API: `exec`, `wait`, `exit`

    - Where a process comes to live and does its stuff

- System calls: creat, open, read, write, seek, tell

    - Most of these depend on `file.h`, `filesys.c`

In our perspective for Pintos, process == thread (since all processes
are single-threaded)

- Eveyr process has a thread struct and a process control block (see 
  `thread.h`).

  ```c
  struct thread {
    struct list children;
    FILE filelist[40];
  };
  ```

Top three problems of Project 2:

1. Launch of a process/ argument passing by argc, argv?

    - programs are called by an assembly instruction: `intr x30`

    - Expectation:

    ``` 
    $ cat file

       top->----------
            |ret addr|
            | argc   |
          |-| argv   |
          |-> argv[0]| --> "cat"
            | argv[1]| --> "somefile.txt"
            | argv[2]| --> NULL
            |        |
            |        |
            |        |
            |        |
            |0 0 0 F |    User
            |I L E \0|   Stack
            ----------
    ```

Dr. Y's alignment function: `tokenize`

    Tokenize the command line arguments passed in and tells about how it's padded

#### Unions
```
    union {
        uint32_t *word;
        char* byte;
    } mysp;

    mysp.word = *(uint32_t)
```

2. `syscall_init`: How do function pointers work?

3. Filesystem.

    - Take small steps. First step: don't even work with files! just STIN and STDOUT

    `int write (int fd, char* pug, int len)1;

Miscellaneous Problems

- Page faults

- Sychroniazation

    - We are using a very naive implementation-- only onen single read/write opration.

    - Dr. Y will be posting useful fcns on Piazza

## Scheduling

1. Workload characterization and assumptions (we'll relax this later).

    - all tasks run for the same amount of time

    - all tasks arrive at the same time

    - Once started, jobs or tasks are non-preemtpive 

    - All tasks use CPU, no IO.

    - All runtimes are known (duration of programs)
