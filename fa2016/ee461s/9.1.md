# EE 461 Lecture -- 9.1.16

## Overview for Today

- Pipes

- Basic I/O

- Signals

## Fun Utilities

- `script`: set a session script that records the bash commands

```
$ script --timing=t9-1.txt -s s9-1.txt
```

To replay a saved script (pauses and all):

```
$ scriptreplay -d 1.0 -m 1 --timing=t9-1.txt -s s9-1.txt
```

Dr. Yerraballi will try to post all of his shell sessions as scripts
so we can replay and study them.

- `man 2` is the Linux programmer's manual (man pages for system programming)


## I/O

Fundamental operations:

- `open`

```c
int fd = open("foo.txt", O-CREAT);
```

- `read`

- `write`

```c
write(fd, "Hi", 2); // prints to fd
write(1, "Hi", 2); // Prints to stdout (the screen)
```

- `close`

```c
close(1);
```

Files are accessed through two mechanisms:

- File descriptors (`int`)

    - Preset file descriptors:

        - `0`: standard input

        - `1`: standard output

        - `2`: standard error

- File pointer (`FILE`)

In the process control block, there is a list of open files. Entries
0-2 are prefilled with `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.


## Redirection inside a C program

`open` returns the first open file descriptor. So, if we close STDOUT...

```c
const int STDOUT_FILENO = 1;
close(STDOUT_FILENO);
open('other_file.txt', ...options); // Now, STDOUT is redirected to other_file.txt
```

## Pipe

Pipelining command chains is an IPC mechanism

- IPC: Inter process communication

    - Related Processes

        - Pipe (most effective)

        - File (kind of crazy)

    - Unrelated Processes

        - Named pipes

        - shared memory

        - message queues

        - UNIX domain sockets

    - Processes on different machines

        - Generic sockets (TCP/UDP)

Pipes are a mode of communication:

```
                Pipeline
             _______________
    write--> |             | --> read
     fd[1]   ---------------     fd[0]
```

```c
int fd[2];
pipe(fd)
```

To establish a pipeline communictaion between a parent and its
child:

- Parent opens pipe

- Parent forks child

- Parent closes `read` end

- Child closes `write` end

```
        Unidirectional Pipe
Parent                   Child
__________               __________
|        |               |        |
|pipe(fd)|               |        |
|exec() ------------------>       |
|close(fd[0])            |close(fd[1])
|        |               |        |
----------               ----------

write(fd[1],"blah",4)   read(fd[0], buf, len)
```

For bi-directional communication, just open two pipes!

```bash
$ cat foo.txt | grep "bar"
```

Shell formed two children:

- `cat`

    - Arg list: 0: cat, 1: foo.txt

    - STDOUT redirected to the write portion of a pipe

- `grep`

    - Arg list: 0: grep, 1: bar

    - STDIN redirected to the read portion of the pipe

### `dup` and `dup2`

`dup(fd)`: creates a copy of the file descriptor using the lowest-numbered 
unused descriptor for the new descriptor.

- Use case:

```c
// Redirect STDIN to the read portion of a pipe
close(STDIN);
dup(pfd[0]); // Where pfd[0] is the read end of a pipe
```

`dup2(oldfd, newfd)`: like `dup`, but it closes the destination file 
descriptor for you.
