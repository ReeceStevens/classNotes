# EE 461S Lecture -- 11.17.16

## Agenda

1. Filesystems as described by OSTEP

- VSFS (very simple file system)

2. Pintos project filesystem

3. Monday office hours

- holding office hours in the gym, he's going to teach yoga for every question
  we ask

- Gym study room (?)

- Bring yoga mat (lol this is awesome)

## Filesystems in OSTEP

Removing a file is not actually a system call

- Instead, it's simply unlinking a file from an inode

**inode**: structure that holds all the information about a file or directory

- Both are actually just normal files

    - **file**: contents are just the raw bytes

    - **directory**: contents are a list of files that make up the directory

- We can distinguish the contents of an inode into *metadata* and *data*.

**Inode Table**

```
  Table Layout
  -------------------------------------------------
  |      |      |      |              |           |
  |super |i-bmap|d-bmap| inode blocks |data blocks|
  |      |      |      |     (5)      |           |
  -------------------------------------------------
  0      4      8      12    ...      32   ...

  Block size is 4 kB
  Total: 64 blocks
    - 5 of these blocks hold inodes
    - 56 blocks for data
    - 1 block for bmaps
    - 1 super block

  inode size: 256 bytes
    - Therefore, 1 block has 16 inodes
    - since we have 5 inode blocks, -> 80 inodes
    - Therefore, this example filesystem can only hold 80 files.
        - this includes directories!
```

Files and directories are referred to by their path

- Need a way to convert paths to inodes

- `struct file *fptr` represents the OS's method of keeping track of state

- Looking up a file:

    - Look up the root inode (you should always know where this is once you
      load the filesystem). The location should be part of the *superblock*

    - The *superblock* has:

        - filesystem type

        - Root directory (in linux, root is always inode #2)

Mange inodes and data blocks

- bitmap for free/allocated data blocks

- bitmap for free/allocated inodes

What does a read of a file entail?

- See figure 40.3 in OSTEP

- When performing a read, you read the inode, read the data block, then write
  the access information to the inode

- Takeaway: `read`'s activity is governed by the size of the file

    - `open`'s activity is governed by the path to the file

What about `create`?

- Figure 40.4

## Pintos FS

Where to start?

- use userprog as the starting point

    - All userprog tests should pass

- New tests (filesys-specific): 44

    - Most entail the following:

        - Directories

        - Growing files (i.e. read/seek/write past the EOF)

        - Synchronization (currently coarse-grained, i.e. single fs lock)

            - must be fine grained to the block level

        - Support both absolute and relative paths

            - process creation sets its current working directory to root

            - child process inherits the parent's current working directory

First steps

- Add new syscalls

    - `chdir`- change directory

    - `mkdir` - make directory

    - `readdir` - read directory

        - returns boolean

        - takes a file descriptor and a pointer to a name

        - In a way, it's an iterator (successive calls to this command will
          print out all the file names in the directory)

    - `isdir(int fd)` returns directory

    - `inumber(int fd)` returns inode
