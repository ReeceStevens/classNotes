## Today: Test Review

Mexican-American War

- How it started: Pres Polk's attitude and provocation

- Flip-flopped a lot

- Voted against the Kansas-Nebraska act

- Governor when TX was leaving the union

- Retired after succession

James Polk

- Responsible for Mx american war. Did it deliberately b/c MX wasn't going to
  sell part of its own country. Polk started war as an excuse to take the land
  from MX

Whig Party

- Active in TX in the late 1840s-50s.

- Anglo population of TX was strongly sympathetic towards Dems, not Whigs

- Whigs resisted MX American war, TX annexation, crazy TX western boundary
  claims

- Most abolitionists came from the Whig party

- Destroyed by the Kansas-Nebraska act

- James Throckmorton and Edmund Davis became important during reconstruction--
  both were governors during reconstruction

Democratic Party

- Tx votes democratic every single time until 1928 (beyond the scope of the
  test)

Zachary Taylor

- Hero of MX American War

- Elected pres in 1848 w/o the TX vote

- Even though he was a southern slaveowner, once the war was over, he wanted to
  rush NMX and Arizona into the union as free states

    - He was very unsympathetic to TX western boundary claims as well

- Died in office in 1850, was replaced by his VP who was southern-sympathetic

    - Passed the compromise of 1850

Wilmot Proviso

- amendment to apropriations bills needed to pay for the MX war

- Never passed into law

- Slavery would be banned from any land acquired by US as a result of the MX
  American War

Missouri Compromise

- Missouri joined union in 1821

- No slavery in the rest of the Lousiana Purchase area

- No slavery north of Missouri's southern boundary

- top of the panhandle of TX is the missouri boundary line

- Idea was to extend that line all the way to the pacific ocean

Popular Sovereignty

- Let each group of settlers in each territory decide for themselves

- Problem: When would they get to vote? Before the vote, is slavery allowed?

- Takeaway: Popular soverignty worked in NMX and utah, but it was a collosal
  failure in Kansas

Dred Scott

- Says that slavery is legal in *all* territories

- also claimed that Missouri Compromise wasn't constitutional

New Mexico Boundary Controversy

- US Army turned back TX settlers trying to settle territories

Compromise of 1850

    2. Utah is territory w/o mention of slavery

    3. NMX bill, includes our western boundary (no mention of slavery)

    4. Fugitive slave law

        - Very controversioal

    5. Abolition of the slave trade in Washington DC

- This was the first time states started considering leaving the union

Kansas-Nebraska Act

  the slaves in Harpers' Ferry in Virginia. 

- Tried and hanged, but he gave lots of interviews through his trial

    - Attracted a lot of sympathy for his actions

Constitutional Union Party

  hostile to the united states

Black Codes

  very reminiscint of slavery

14th Amendment

Radical and Moderate Republicans

- Moderate: Trying to repair the union

consititution of 1869
