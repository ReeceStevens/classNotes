## Overview

Spanish Texas from 1760's to the 1820's

- French and Indian War changed Spain's policy towards Texas

- The Louisiana purchase created tension between Spain and the United States
  over Texas (1803)

    - Tension was because Jefferson decided that Texas was part of Louisiana
      (which it totally wasn't)

- The Mexican War of Independence threatened Spanish control of Texas

    - Creoles vs. Peninsulars

    - Ends up being a kind of counter-revolution agains the democratic
      government being put into place in Spain

## Continuing with Timeline (post 1820)

1820 - Ferdinand VII forced to restore constitution of 1812. Conservatives in
       Spain alarmed at liberal turn in Spanish government

1821 - Moses Austin petitions to be allowed to settle in TX

    - Moses wanted to bring several hundred families to Texas and act as an
      empresario over 200,000 acres -- turned down outright.

        - His friend (dutchman who had become Spanish citizen called himself
          "Baron of Bassdrop"; he was a tax embezzler) had influence and
          interceded. Changed the mind of the governor of TX, Austin was able
          to enter into a grant with govt.

        - Moses gets sick and dies, gives grant to his son Stephen

    - Stephen Austin goes to MX city for one year to seek approval of new
      government (b/c new government, didn't honor old grant)

    - Spain starts the trend of legal foreign immigration; Mexico continues it
      (although they didn't really have a choice since so many ppl were coming
      over the border anyways)

    - Gen. Agustin de Iturbide sent to quell revolt against Spain joins other
      side. Mexico declares her *independence* from Spain

1822 - Iturbide crowned emperor for life on May 19, deposed 10 months later in
       revolt led by Santa Anna

       - Mexico doesn't have a great opinion of Iturbide or Santa Anna

       - Mexico government founded under "Three Guarantees":

            1. Mexico would be ruled by a monarch

            2. One true religion (Catholic)

            3. Equality between Creoles and Peninsulars

      - Iturbide was sentenced to deth in absentia (awkward)

      - Santa Anna is a "friend" of democracy for a while

            - Then later he changes his mind

            - Regionalism starts threatening the unity of Mexico, so Santa Anna
              decides Mexico has to be ruled by a dictator

            - Before the Texas independence movement, we thought he was one of
              the good guys

1821-22 - First settlers of Austin's colony arrive. "Old 300"

    - They moved to a portion of Texas where really nobody else was

    - They still felt like they had allegiance to the US

1822-23 - Austin spends year in MX City getting new MX govt to approve his land
          grant

1823 - Austin distributes land titles at San Felipe de Austin under Imperial
       Colonization Law of 1823

        - Texas population grows geometrically, and it's almost all anglos

        - Mexico tried to close the border in the 30s, but didn't really work

        - Relationship between anglos and Mexicans was pretty placid throughout
          the 20s because they lived so far apart. That changed in the 30s

1824 - New Mexican Constitution adopted

    - Coahuila and Texas united as one state with capital at Saltillo

    - National Colonization law gives states control over immigration and
      development of public lands

    - States could formulate their own immigration policy??? wow.

    - Also could develop local militias

    - Texas hung onto its public land when it joined the union, so that's why
      we have a bunch of state parks instead of national parks

    - Constitution was very popular in Texas at this time

1825 - Texas made a department of Coahuila and Texas

    - Coahuila-Texas legistlature passes colonization law in March

        - Time limits placed on slavery, and general limitations on slavery as
          an institution

        - Unfortunately, these laws weren't really enforced-- but they did
          cause slaveowners to get nervous

        - Religious independence wasn't really that big of a deal. Slavery,
          unfortunately, was a much bigger deal and probably played a major
          role in precipitating the Texas Independence movement

    - First US minister to Mexico offers to buy Texas as far as the Brazos for
      $1M and commercial treaty

## "Failure" of Spanish colonial policy in Texas

Failure from the standpoint of establishing a large Spanish population.

Success from the standpoint of keeping TX from falling into foreign hands.

Reasons for failure:

    - Commercial policy

    - Poor quality of military officials on frontier

    - Isolation of TX from Spain and MX city

    - Hostile native population

    - Spanish colonial institution unsuited to TX

    - Spanish interest in gold, silver and other precious metals

Spain didn't try to build its colony system on exports; commercial policy was
very restrictive

## Spanish Texas: Part 2 (pull this up on Canvas to fill in the blanks)

1. By eliminating France from NA, the French and INdian war eliminated Spain's
   main reason for occupying East Texas and brought the third occupation to an
   end.

2. The creation of spanish louisinana gave spanish amarica its first epxerience

   ...

6. The gutierrez-magee expedition was an outgrowth of the Mexican
    indepenedence movement and almost cretaed an indpenedent texas for the
    first time

7. the adams-onis treaty created a "final" boundary between the US and Spanish
   America  but most American sin the Old Southwest did not accept its
   legitimacy

8. While spain failed to settle a large European population in Texas, its
   legacy includes place name,s historical records, ranching methods, etc.
