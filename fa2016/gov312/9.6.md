## Overview

Spanish Texas from 1760's to the 1820's

- French and Indian War changed Spain's policy towards Texas

- The Louisiana purchase created tension between Spain and the United States
  over Texas (1803)

    - Tension was because Jefferson decided that Texas was part of Louisiana
      (which it totally wasn't)

- The Mexican War of Independence threatened Spanish control of Texas

    - Creoles vs. Peninsulars

    - Ends up being a kind of counter-revolution agains the democratic
      government being put into place in Spain

## Continuing with Timeline (post 1820)

1820 - Ferdinand VII forced to restore constitution of 1812. Conservatives in
       Spain alarmed at liberal turn in Spanish government

1821 - Moses Austin petitions to be allowed to settle in TX

    - Moses wanted to bring several hundred families to Texas and act as an
      empresario over 200,000 acres -- turned down outright.

        - His friend (dutchman who had become Spanish citizen called himself
          "Baron of Bassdrop"; he was a tax embezzler) had influence and
          interceded. Changed the mind of the governor of TX, Austin was able
          to enter into a grant with govt.

        - Moses gets sick and dies, gives grant to his son Stephen

    - Stephen Austin goes to MX city for one year to seek approval of new
      government (b/c new government, didn't honor old grant)

    - Spain starts the trend of legal foreign immigration; Mexico continues it
      (although they didn't really have a choice since so many ppl were coming
      over the border anyways)

    - Gen. Agustin de Iturbide sent to quell revolt against Spain joins other
      side. Mexico declares her *independence* from Spain

1822 - Iturbide crowned emperor for life on May 19, deposed 10 months later in
       revolt led by Santa Anna

       - Mexico doesn't have a great opinion of Iturbide or Santa Anna

       - Mexico government founded under "Three Guarantees":

            1. Mexico would be ruled by a monarch

            2. One true religion (Catholic)

            3. Equality between Creoles and Peninsulars

      - Iturbide was sentenced to deth in absentia (awkward)

      - Santa Anna is a "friend" of democracy for a while

            - Then later he changes his mind

            - Regionalism starts threatening the unity of Mexico, so Santa Anna
              decides Mexico has to be ruled by a dictator

            - Before the Texas independence movement, we thought he was one of
              the good guys

1821-22 - First settlers of Austin's colony arrive. "Old 300"

    - They moved to a portion of Texas where really nobody else was

    - They still felt like they had allegiance to the US

1822-23 - Austin spends year in MX City getting new MX govt to approve his land
          grant

1823 - Austin distributes land titles at San Felipe de Austin under Imperial
       Colonization Law of 1823

        - Texas population grows geometrically, and it's almost all anglos

        - Mexico tried to close the border in the 30s, but didn't really work

        - Relationship between anglos and Mexicans was pretty placid throughout
          the 20s because they lived so far apart. That changed in the 30s

1824 - New Mexican Constitution adopted

    - Coahuila and Texas united as one state with capital at Saltillo

    - National Colonization law gives states control over immigration and
      development of public lands

    - States could formulate their own immigration policy??? wow.

    - Also could develop local militias

    - Texas hung onto its public land when it joined the union, so that's why
      we have a bunch of state parks instead of national parks

    - Constitution was very popular in Texas at this time

1825 - Texas made a department of Coahuila and Texas

    - Coahuila-Texas legistlature passes colonization law in March

        - Time limits placed on slavery, and general limitations on slavery as
          an institution

        - Unfortunately, these laws weren't really enforced-- but they did
          cause slaveowners to get nervous

        - Religious independence wasn't really that big of a deal. Slavery,
          unfortunately, was a much bigger deal and probably played a major
          role in precipitating the Texas Independence movement

    - First US minister to Mexico offers to buy Texas as far as the Brazos for
      $1M and commercial treaty

1826-27 - Fredonian Rebellion (December to January)

    - Edwards brothers had land in East Tx (area around Nacadoches, hispanic
      population already there)

        - Told population "you've gotta buy the land you're on", ppl didn't
          like that

        - San Antonio decides that Edwards bothers contract was cancelled after
          the population appealed against them

    - brothers refused to leave, captured Nacadoches and claimed to create the
      "republic of fredonian"

        - Other empresarios helped the mexican govt kick the edwards brothers
          out of Texas

    - General Teran arrives to see if this was something he needed to worry
      about.

1827 - (June) 200 troops arrive in Nacogdoches under Col. Piedras, (Sept)
       Legislature of Coahuila & Texas enacts a law limiting slavery

1828 - General Teran recommends military occupation of TX and colonization of
       TX with MX and German citizens (basically anybody but Americans)

    - Germans ended up coming in the 1830s

1829 - National law of 1829: Mexico declares slavery illegal, TX exempted

    - peonage was still a thing (basically indefinite indentured servitude)

    - Mexico was planning on ending the exemption for Texas gradually

        - That didn't really work. see Civil War.

1830 - Law of April 1830 provides for military occupation and closing of US-MX
       border

       - Liberals were people who wanted states rights (also called
         Federalists)

       - Conservatives / Centralists wanted a very strong president

1831 - (Fall) John Bradburn, MX military commander at Anahuac, closes all TX
       ports except Anahuac and dissolves ayuntamiento at Liberty

       - This guy becomes really unpopular because of this

1832 - (May) Bradburn arrests William B. Travis & Patrick Jack on charges of
sedition

    - Travis and Jack were just held in jail for a long time. Anglos thought
      this was wrong (fair and speedy trial in American constitution), still
      thought of themselves as Americans

    - (June) Insurrection of '32 (or first battle of Anahuac). Battles also at
      Velasco and Nacogdoches

        - Basically ask for getting rid of Bradburn

        - Weirdly, they get their way for the most part

            - Bradburn removed

            - Mexican troops withdrawn to San Antonio

            - Customs houses closed

    - (October) Convention at San Felipe asks for repeal law of 1830 and
      statehood for Texas

        - Also want to reopen border with US

        - "Peacefully petitioning the govt" was illegal in Mexico (oops, forgot
          what constitution they were under again)

    - (December) Pres. Bustamante overthrown by Santa Anna

        - Texas is cheering for Santa Anna right now

    - Sam Houston arrives in Texas via the Indian territories

        - Grew up with the Cherokees in his teenage years

        - Became a protege of Andrew Jackson

        - Later on moved back with the Cherokees, called "big drunk"

        - Somehow, he ended up in Texas (probably for $$$ and opportunity)

1833 - (March) Capital of Coahuila and Texas moved to Monclova

        - "Clash of two cultures"; anglos saw movement of capital as a sign of
          disorganized, uncivilized government

        (April) 2nd Anglo convention held at San Felipe

        (Summer) Austin sent to Mexico City to present grievances and proposed
        state constitution to acting President Gomez Farias (Santa Anna just
        heads off to chill at his estate)

        (July-Dec) (vice president) Gomez Farias & Austin reach agreement on most issues except
        separate statehood for Texas

        (Oct) Austin letter ayuntamiento in San Antonio causes his arrest in
        Saltillo in Jan '34 on his way back to Texas

## "Failure" of Spanish colonial policy in Texas

Failure from the standpoint of establishing a large Spanish population.

Success from the standpoint of keeping TX from falling into foreign hands.

Reasons for failure:

    - Commercial policy

    - Poor quality of military officials on frontier

    - Isolation of TX from Spain and MX city

    - Hostile native population

    - Spanish colonial institution unsuited to TX

    - Spanish interest in gold, silver and other precious metals

Spain didn't try to build its colony system on exports; commercial policy was
very restrictive

## Spanish Texas: Part 2 (pull this up on Canvas to fill in the blanks)

1. By eliminating France from NA, the French and INdian war eliminated Spain's
   main reason for occupying East Texas and brought the third occupation to an
   end.

2. The creation of spanish louisinana gave spanish amarica its first epxerience

   ...

6. The gutierrez-magee expedition was an outgrowth of the Mexican
    indepenedence movement and almost cretaed an indpenedent texas for the
    first time

7. the adams-onis treaty created a "final" boundary between the US and Spanish
   America  but most American sin the Old Southwest did not accept its
   legitimacy

8. While spain failed to settle a large European population in Texas, its
   legacy includes place name,s historical records, ranching methods, etc.
