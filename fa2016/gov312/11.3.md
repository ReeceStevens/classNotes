## World War I and the 1920s

1. For Texans, World War I was a progressive crusade that produced women's
   suffrange and Prohibition, but also a spirit of intolerance

    - "With us or against us" mentality

    - Lots of more repressive laws passed

2. Fergusonism, Prohibition, and the KKK were the three big political issues in
   Texas in the 1920s

    - "The hood, the bonnet, and the little brown jug"

        - KKK

            - They decided to enter politics and run Klan candidates for office

            - "Rebranded" themselves as the "guardians of family values"

            - Widespread social change fueled this reactionary change

            - Jim Ferguson came back b/c he attacked the KKK

                - not because of their bigotry, but more of a political
                  calculation

        - Women's suffrage

        - Prohibition

3. During the 1920s, Texas Democrats went from solid support for the national
   Democratic party to voting for a Republican presidential candidate for the
   first time
