## Lab 10 Demo

In lab 10 circuit:

- Rf is used to provide hysteresis

    - Without it, you'll get multiple false edges

- Use a TIP120 instead of a 2N2222 transistor b/c higher maximum current

- Differentce btwn BJT and Darlington

    - Darlington has multiple transistors => larger gain

- Could also have used MOSFET

    - Didn't choose it here b/c you need a fairly large `V_gs` (diff between
      gate and source) to turn it on. 3.3V won't really provide enough 
      "on-ness" to get desired behavior.

- Even though there's only 5V being supplied, you can see higher than 5V in the
  PWM output. This is due to the inductance of the motor

    - the dramatic current change on the edge of the PWM causes a huge voltage
      swing. The reason this is only a little over 5V as opposed to 200V or
      more is because of the snubber diode we include around the motor.
