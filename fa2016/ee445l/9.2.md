# EE 445L Lecture -- 9.2.16

## Last Time

Abstraction

    - Data flow graphs

    - Separation between `*.h` and `*.c` files

## I/O Synchronization

- When sychronizing, we need to be able to measure the sync process

## Interrupts

- Thread (def.): path of action of software as it executes

- Cortex M NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)

    - Interrupt priorities

    - Enable and clear enable registers

    - Set-pending and clear-pending registers

- Requires setting three flags

    - arm/enable bit

    - NVIC bit

    - Individual interrupt flags (in PRIMASK)

            ```asm
            ; disable interrupts
            CPSID I
            ; enable interrupts
            CPSIE I
            ```
