## Interfacing

###Data Transfer Timing Requirements

Two intervals: time that the data is made available by the sender, and the time
that the receiver requires the data to be available for

Available means output, required means a specification

Setup and hold are the two interval names

### SSI Interface

Ordinary configuration causes data transfer to begin on the rising edge so that
it can be read on the falling edge. The data must be held long enough to be
read by the processor (about 5 ns). `SS_max = (1/2)T - 8 ns`

See slides for equation for picking SSI clock frequency.

Setup and hold is *def* gonna be on the exam.

## Music Generation

Measure of music beauty: signal to noise ratio

`SNR = 20log_10(signal/noise)`

    - DAC resolution

    - Frequency resolution

Exam question:

`20log_10(2 volts)` <-- this doesn't make sense. units are a log of a volt? no.

Logs require that it be a *ratio*

Better expression:

`20log_10(Vin/2.5V)`

deltaF = 1/(N*delta)
