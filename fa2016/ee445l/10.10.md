# EE 445L Lecture -- 10.10.16

## Announcements

Moving up the due dates of stuff!!!!!

- Delay lab 7 demo and lab 7 prep

## Continuing: Regulators

What?

- Produces a constant output voltage from an input voltage

Why?

- Variable load on current might cause an unknown `v_in`

- walwart or other converters may not have constant output

    - Unregulated input

- reduces voltage line noise

How?

Specifications?

- Vin, Vout

- Iout

- Noise tolerance

- Efficiency

## Enclosures and Connectors

Dr. Valvano has acrylic sheets in his office

Laser cutter

- Design in PCBArtist (note, mil == milli*inches*)

- Set snap to grid to 93 mil thickness

- Create height, width, length

- Down-size slots by 3.6 mil each side (93 to 84)

- There are starter projects here:
