## Last time: Interrupts

- A hardware-triggered software action

*Possible exam question*

If you've got 8 things, how do you assign priority?

    - optimize so that the shortest deadline has the highest priority

    - optimize so that highest frequence I/O is the highest priority

        - Counterexample: smoke detector (how often does a fire happen? Do you
          still want it to go off when there's a fire?)

*When an interrupt happens:*

- We get a trigger

- Complete the instruction (some instructions take a bit longer to finish
  if they're non-atomic)

- Push 8 registers on the stack (0, 1, 2, 3, 12, LR, PC, PSW) didn't catch the
  others... look it up in the book)

- Context switch

- Sets program interrupt counter

- Set Link register

- Set IPSR

Real time System jitter

## Critical Sections and Reentrant Code

Critical Section

- shared global

- nonatomic access

- at least one write

Read-Modify-Write to a global can be a critical section in your code.

Example: reading and printing the time

    Solution: pack both the hours and minutes into a single read!
