# EE 445L Lecture -- 8.29.16

Last time: definition of real-time

    - Def: bounded latency

    - Comparison of hard, firm, and soft real-time

## Fixed point numbers

How do we represent non-integer values?

### Integers

    - Fixed width integer numbers

### Floating Point multiplication on the Cortex M

    - Has its own special registers for floating point (S0, S1, etc.)

    - Special assembler instructions (VADD, VMUL, etc.)

    - Valvano: don't use it, when you use interrupts you've gotta push all that
      crap onto the stack.

### Fixed point number (`I * delta`)

    - Can use when the range is known and small

    - Store `I`, but `delta` is fixed

    - Decimal fixed-point (`delta` = 10^m) = I * 10^m

    - Binary fixed-point) (`delta` = 2^m) = I * 2^m

### Floating point number (I * B^E)

    - Store both I and E (only B=2 is fixed)

## Why Fixed Point Numbers?

Why:

    - Express values with non-integer values

    - no floating point hardware support

Resolution:

- 32 bit floating point vs. 32-bit fixed point

    - In the range of 0-3.3V, fixed point has better resolution

        - Floating point only has 23 bits of mantissa

        - Fixed point has the whole 32

Moral of the story:

    - Fixed point is better at resolution

    - Floating point is great for large dynamic range

    - Which is faster? extra credit question in lab

## Designing a fixed-point number

Range: 0-3.3V, 1mV noise

    - 3300 possible values (about 12 bits, so represented as 16 bits unsigned)

    - 2^n * delta

    - Check out the "Create a voltmeter" slide.

## Overflow

Review:

    - let x be a number with `n` bits

    - let y be a number with `m` bits

    - then, x + y will require `n + m` bits
