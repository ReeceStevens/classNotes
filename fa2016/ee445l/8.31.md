## Graphics

All about abstraction!

Abstraction requires three things:

    - Header file (interface)

    - Source file (implementation)

    - Test file (ensuring everything works)

## Data flow graphs

Manage how data flows through a system

    - Circles: software component

    - Rectangles: hardware components

    - Systems

        - components

        - Interfaces

    - Arrows

        - Data format

        - Data Bandwidth

        - Data direction

Determining the bottleneck of the system:

    - What point has the largest bandwidth, i.e. the most information
      flowing?

## Architecture
Bit banded addressing

There's a 32 bit memory location, then there's a separate location for
accessing a single bit in that original location

## Interfaces

- Hardware and software that combine to allow the computer to communicate with
  the external hardware

- Must be able to adapt to a wide range of inputs and outputs

- Friendly code leaves the rest of the bits alone when modifying a bit

Notable pins in port C:

    - PC0-PC3 are related to JTAG, messing with them will cause debugging to
      crash

- *Desolder R9 and R10 on the launchpad*

UART, SSI, I2C, SPI

Timers

    - Fixed periodic rate interrupts

    - Pulse Width Modulated outputs (PWM)

    - Input capture used for period and pulse width measurements

    - Time can be an input or output

Bit banded addressing

    - All IO Addresses can be single-bit-addressed

    - All ports

    - All RAM

    - (TI-specific) Can access any combination of port bits

## Valvano core truth

Reduce bandwidth and modularize
