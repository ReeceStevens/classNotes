# EE 445L Lecture -- 8.26.16

## What's an embedded system?
- Def: Anything that uses a processor but isn't a general-purpose computer.
- Takes advantage of application characteristics to optimize design
- Modules and interfaces between modules make up a big system
- Embedded system == cyber-physical system

Properties:
    - includes a microcontroller
    - is configured to perform specific application
    - software solves a limited range of problems
    - microprocessor embedded or hidden inside

Behavior:
    - accepts input
    - performs calculations
    - generates output
    - runs in real time

There are *way* more computers in the world than there are people

Big ideas of the class:
    - HW/SW architecture
    - Bowels of the "operating system"
    - Real world design
    - Analyzability
    - Application-level techniques

*** You're going to have to explain/design analog filters on the first exam ***

Know your power unit fundamentals!

*** EE 360T all about testing software. Probably will be useful! ***

Four categories
    - General computing
    - Control Systems
    - Signal processing
    - Communication & Networking

Real Time Definitions
based on latency bandwidth (response time to stimulus)
    - Hard real-time
        Absolute deadline, beyond which answer is useless
        consequence of missed latency is catastrophic
        may include min time as well as max time
        i.e. airbag deployment
    - Firm real-time
        if you miss deadline, ppl are unhappy 
        missed values have no value after the latency period
        consequence is not necessarily catastrophic, just no value.
        i.e. streaming videos on netflix
    - Soft real-time
        Missing a deadline is not catastrophic, reduced value
        Utility of answer degrades with time

Real time just means bounded latency -- not necessarily "real fast"
