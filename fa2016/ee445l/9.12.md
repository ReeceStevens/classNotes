# EE 445L Lecture - 9.12.16

## From Last Lecture

1. Rate monotonic Theorem

    - Priority ranking according to frequency `f_i = 1/T_i`

    - High frequency = high priority

    - Ei = average execution time

    - Ti = period of task

    - Solution if `sum(E_i/T_i) <= ln(2)`

2. Fair and Equal (whatever that means)

3. Importance (depending on definition)

## Critical Sections

Shared access to permanently allocated data or I/O port

Multistep non-atomic sequence, in which one step is a write.

    - Read modify write

    - Write write

    - Write read

## Disarm vs. Disable

Disable shuts down all interrupts

Disarm is specific to a particular interrupt

## Digital Logic, BJT, Effect of capacitance, Buzzer

In the context of high-speed digital logic, capacitance kills ya.

### Digital Logic Families

`V_IL` = voltage below which an input is considered LOW

`V_IH` = voltage above which an input is considered HIGH

`V_OH` = output voltage for a logic high

`V_OL` = output voltage for a logic low

`I_OH` = amount of current *could* drive if you asked it to.

See the graph on slide 7.

Transistor use in this class:

    - Two staged

    - Operate in cutoff mode to saturation (skip forward active mode)

Square wave generation

    - PWM way

    - Period timer interrupt (Valvo is suggesting doing this)

Possible quiz question: How many watts of heat is generated by the BJT

***First exam: What's the step response of an RC circuit?***
