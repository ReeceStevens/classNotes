## Last Time: Op Amps

Building op-amp range control

Take a function 

    4(Vin - 1.5) + 1.5

    => 4Vin - 3Vref + kVg = 1

    => k = 0  (no ground resistor)


    Assuming Vg = 0, VRef = 1.515

    Vout = 3.3(Vin-1)

    Vout = 3.3Vin - 3.3

    3.3Vin - 2Vref + kVg = 1

    => k = -1.3 (feedback gain for Vg should be 1.3 (i.e. Rf/Rg = 1.3)

## Instrumentation Amplifier

When?

Required conditions:

- Need to amplify a differential voltage

- Shown as V2-V1

then pick one of the following:

- Large gain (> 100)

- High input impedence

- good common mode rejection ratio, or low noise
