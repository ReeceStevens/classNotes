6. Textbook

## Power (not exam 1 review anymore :P)

- Power budget

- batteries

    - primary (single use) vs. secondary

    - add a charger

- Regulator

    - linear

        - very low noise

        - generally, current is equal but voltage is changing

            - Vdo is dropout voltage (Vin > Vout + Vdo). Mandates how low your
              input voltage source can be.

            - Vdo is a regulator property, choose your regulator accordingly

            - Wasted power: Pwasted = Vdo*Iout

    - buck-boost

        -large voltage drop

        - voltage increase

        - very efficient (Power out over power in)

            - Any lost power comes out as thermal energy

                - Thermal resistance (units of `Watts/degreeC`) tells you how
                  hot things will get
