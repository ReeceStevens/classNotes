# EE 445L Lecture -- 10.3.16

## Exam 1 coming up

`users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/EE345LFinal/`

Stick within the last two years or so.

Can bring an 9.5x11 crib sheet

Valvano is giving us a table of timer registers, GPIO registers, NVIC
  registers, etc.

You should know your powers of two (or put them on your crib sheet)

Exam will be long. Prioritize covering all the questions rather than getting
every question correct, Valvano gives partial credit for that.

Most important thing out of lab X (Valvano wants to focus on big picture stuff)

**No calculator**


### Topic Questions

- Snubber diode, BJT (prevents backflow)

- RC Circuits

- critilcal sections

- ISRs short and bounded

- Assigning priority (time to deadline, turnaround time)

- See study guide for exhaustive list

### static

- changes allocation to permanent for a variable

- make a function only accessible to that file

- make a global only accessible to that file

Modularity

Reducing coupling means:

    - more module nodes

    - Less bandwith in each arrow connecting those nodes

BJT:

    - We run in saturated, off mode

    - N channel interface, not P

Central Limit Theorem

cohesion
