## Final Project Notes

- You can spend more than $30 on the final project if you want, but
  you can't win the competition that way

## Designing a System

### Device Properties

Resistor

- Wattage

- physical size

- type

- resistance

- calibration standard

Capacitors

- Type (ceramic, tantalum, electrolyte, etc.)

- voltage rating

- tolerance (C0G for crystal, X7R for filters, ceramic bypass)

- Numbering system for capacitors:

    123 = 12 * 10 ^ 3 pF = 12nF
