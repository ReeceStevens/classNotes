## Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ)

### Principles of Invention

- Inventive solutions arise from the resolution of contradictions

- A contradiction exists when attempts to improve one feature causes another
  feature to degrade

    - i.e. Strength vs weight, acceleration vs. fuel consumption

- Similar contradictions have been seen repeatedly and solved in similar waysa

### 8 Basic Patterns of Evolution

1. Evolution to Systems

2. Non-Uniform development of system elements

3. Transition to supersystem

4. Evolution with matching and mismatching elements

5. Evolution toward increased ideality

6. Evolution toward micro-level

7. Evolution towards increased use of fields

8. Evolution towards increased dynamism and controllability
