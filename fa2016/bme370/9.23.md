## Intellectual Property Basics

Intellectual property is defined as the products of human intellect that have
economic value.

The owner of a patent must protect that patent in court.

America is now a first-to-file patent system (since 2011)

    - public disclosure before patent protection => someone else can patent it
      and *own* the idea.

Inventor is the person who conceived the idea

Assignee is the person who owns the rights to the patent

Must be shown through documentation

UT's policy: they're the assignee

    - after paying for patent fees, licensing fees are split 50/50, university
      and inventor.

A year after public disclosure, the device is considered to be in the public
domain (i.e. you can't file a patent on it).
