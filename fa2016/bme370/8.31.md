## Needs Filtering

- Customer Need (def): Precise statement that "represents the change in outcome
  or practice that is required to address a defined problem"

- Understand customer needs

    - Who is the customer?

    - Gathering customer needs

    - Prioritizing customer needs

- What kind of need is it, or how obvious is it?

    - Direct: customer states what they want

    - Latent: customer doesn't know they need it (i.e. Post-it notes)

- Constant vs. Variable need

    - i.e. constantly deliver accurate amounts of insulin

    - variable: make needle less painful

- *Needs Filtering* - use your design/needs criteria to filter down to the most
  critical needs that you want to solve.
