# BME 370 Lecture - 9.12.16

## Announcements

- Beginning Phase II: Concept Development

- One more remaining quiz (next Monday)

- Two more Redesign assignments

    - Feeback from these assignments will go into the final report.

- After that's complete, we'll have 3 weeks to build prototype/testing.

## Case Study Part II: Continued

Disease fundamentals research

    - Treatment options and summary data

    - Outcome data

    - Market analysis model

Key points:

    - They continued to pursue multiple avenues

    - No discussion of solutions

    - Design targets haven't been discussed explicitly yet, but they should be!

## Key Points For Writing

- "edit, edit, edit"

- avoid passive voice

- Introduce a figure before it appears in the text

- Writing style: "Scientific American test"

    - Define everything as you write it

- Keep paragraph structures simple, topic sentence first

- Never use the following words:

    - done, actually, about, looking at, came up with, have to be, made,
      null hypothesis

    - Not precise enough to tell us what's going on

## Lab Rules

- Label everything

- Don't leave a mess

- Be cognisant of resources

    - Machine shop!!

    - Thermal imaging camera

    - Electronics components

## Concept Development and Ideation

Apply some architecture to concept generation

Invention isn't an "aha" moment

Preparation for Friday's class: Bring design conflicts

Two categories:

1. Intuitive methods (divergent thinking)

2. Directed methods (convergent thinking)

Must perform one of these CG techniques for your assignment:

### Classic Brainstorming

- Have somebody record the session

- Individuals suggest ideas

    - Piggyback vs. leapfrog

- Evaluate ideas at conclusion of discussion

- Useful to generate new ideas and relieve deadlock

- Drawback

    - Right idea might not come at the "right time"

    - Difficult to document

    - relies on willingness to participate

- Prepare in advance

- Set goals for the meeting

Guidelines:

    - Defer judgement

    - Opt for original and off-beat

    - Vast numbers are important

    - Expand on ideas by hitchhiking (piggybacking)

### Mind Mapping

- Write problem in the center

- Add ideas, cluster into hierarchical groups

### 6-3-5 Method

Six individuals

Each individual writes down three ideas

5 rounds of exchange

Takes wayyyy too long.
