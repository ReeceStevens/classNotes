    - What's the difference between science and engineering?

        Science is:
            - Discovering new information and understanding physical phenomena
            - Seeking explanations for what I observe
            - Scientific method
            - Inquiry based

        Engineering is:
            - Applying science in an economic manner to the needs of mankind
            - First solution isn't your final solution
            - Design for constraints
            - Engineering Design Method
            - Needs based

    - Engineering Design Method:

        1. Problem definition

            - Avoid solution fixation (don't get fixed on an idea early on)

        2. Concept generation

        3. Solution Implementation

            - From an educational standpoint, this is considered the least important

- Define Design

    - Def: Product development: Entire set of activities required to bring a product to
      market readiness

    - Def: Design process: set of technical activities within the product development 
      process that work to meet the marketing and business case vision

- Output of Design

    - Companies will want a product

    - Evidence of feasibility (this class)
