## Product Regulation and FDA

### FDA History

1976: 

Prior to this, physicians and doctors could do pretty much whatever they wanted
in terms of materials, etc.

New Device regulations:

- Existing devices grandfathered in

- New devices subject to full regulation

- New devices substantially equivalent to existing device were
  grandfathered in.

FDA Classificaitions

- Patient monitor would fall under class II devices

    - "Not life saving, but must meet performance standards"

    - 510(k) establishes safety and efficacy, but it's less intense than the
      PMA application

        - General Controls

        - Special Controls I
