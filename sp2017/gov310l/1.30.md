# GOV 310 Lecture -- 1.30.17

## Constitution Outline

### Separation of Powers

Three branches

- Executive

- Legislative

- Judiciary

Checks and balances exist between each branch.

### Other Notable Points

Supremacy clause

- Constitution and national law are superior to state laws (i.e. state vs.
  national law conflicts default to the national law)

Elastic clause

- "Necessary and proper clause"

- Congress has the power to make what laws are "necessary in proper"

- Gives the gov't the power to adapt and change with the population

Enumerated powers

- The powers explicitly written down in the Constitution

- i.e. power to tax, coin money, develop nat'l defense

Implied Powers

- Powers gained by the interpretation of the laws and enumerated powers

- A lot of rulings boil down to implied powers extended from the interstate
  commerce law (i.e. desegregation laws)

Bill of rights

- First 10 amendments to the constitution concerned about basic liberties

- Federalists didn't think these needed to be explicitly laid out since every
  state constitution had these already written down

- Antifederalists didn't want these rights to be contingent upon a state's
  whims

Full faith and credit clause

- Requires the states to recognize civil judgements by courts of other states
  and respect federal records

- i.e. If you get married in one state, you're married in all states

- Your driver's license is valid in all states

### Ratification of the Constitution

- 9 of 13 states had to ratify the Constitution

- Two major camps were divided over ratification: Federalists and
  Antifederalists

    - Federalists came mostly from urban areas

    - Antifederalists mostly came from farming and rural areas

### The Debate

- Federalists and antifederalists waged their debate in newspapers and
  pamphlets

- *The Federalist Papers* were actually newspaper segments, and they were
  generally written as responses to articles from the *Antifederalist Papers*

- New York was really the swing state for ratification, so all these debates
  were held in the NY papers

- Federalists favored the constitution, they were arguing for support of a
  strong national government

    - i.e. Alexander Hamilton

- Antifederalists were worried about losing rights and advocated for states
  rights

    - Wanted government closer to the people

    - Many were older and had lived through some of the kings

    - Worried the nat'l govenerment would rule by force rather than consent of
      the governed

    - i.e. Patric Henry

    - Biggest gripe: lack of a Bill of Rights. They strongarmed the Bill of
      Rights to be added to the Constitution

### Ratification and Approval

- Most small states quickly approved

- Virginia and New York were narrow approvals

- Americans accepted the new govenrment fairly quickly... (sort of)

    - Kicked out pretty much all of the British loyalists and took away their
      land

    - George Washington (American Revolution superstar) thumbs-upped the
      Constitution, so that convinced a lot of Americans

### Constitutional Change

There are three ways to change the constitution:

1. Formal amendment

2. Judicial interpretation

3. Political Practice

There are only 27 amendments since the Constitution's creation. How do they
work?

#### Amendments

Two ways for an amendment to work:

1. National convention called by congress by the request of state legislatures
   (never, ever used)

2. Proposal for change by 2/3 vote in both houses of Congress (called a "super
   majority" or "deliberative will"), then ratification by states:

    - Vote in 3/4 of State legislatures (most common), OR

    - vote by special ratifying conventions in 3/4 of the states (only used for
      the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition)

Why are their so few amendments?

- Congress extraordinary majority

- > 10,000 amendments submitted, 33 actually got through Congress

    - Of those 33, 6 amendments were *not* ratified by the states
