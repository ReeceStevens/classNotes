# GOV 310 Lecture -- 2.8.17

## From last time: Division of Powers

- Denied Powers

    - Bill of Attainer

    - Ex Post Facto Laws

    - Powers denied just to the state governments

        - States can't form treaties with foreign governments

        - States can't coin money

        - States can't impair the obligation of contracts

        - States can't join a compact without the permission of the federeral
          gov't

    - Powers denided just to the national

        - Fed gov't can't play favorites with the states

        - Not allowed to place duties on items exported on any state

## Development of Federalism in the USA

- Marshall Court

    - John Marshall was chief justice of supreme court (Marshall Court). He put
      "the teeth into the supreme court" by instituting judicial review
      (Marbury vs. Madison)

    - McCulloch v. Maryland

      - Establishes the necessary and proper clause.

      - Court case: Maryland didn't want the federal bank to be established on
        their land; court case ruled that Maryland can't tax the nat'l bank
        because it was "necessary and proper" for the survival of the country.

- Nullification

    - States do not have to obey unconstitutional laws, and the states get to
      decide what is unconstitutional

    - It's an attempt to declare national laws unconstitutional

    - Nullification lost out after the Civil War... sort of. People seem to be
      making these arguments again though.

- Preemption

    - Right to preclude enforcement of a state or local law or regulation

    - Federal law takes precedence over the enforcement of state or local laws,
      not only when they are in conflict but also if they also touch a field
      where federal interests are so dominant that federal laws are considered
      superior (i.e. water quality, civil liberties, immigration)

- Centralists and Decentralists (devolution)

    - Centralists want more power in the national government; more centralized
      power

    - Decentralists (devolutionists) want less power in the nat'l government
      and more power at the state and local levels

### The Civil War Amendments

Power of the federal government expands to make the states adhere to new
national standards

- 13th: Abolish slavery

- 15th: former male slaves have the right to vote

- 14th

    - Due process clause in 14th amendment (incorporation doctrine)

    - Equal protection clause

    - Remedial legislation comes from Section 5 of the 14th

        - National law can address discriminatory state law

## Different Types of Federalism

- Dual Federalism (this was the US until the 1930s)

    - Called "Layer cake federalism"

        - Probably more accurate to say there are 50 tiny cupcakes and one big
          national cupcake

    - Each level of power remains supreme in its own jurisdiction

    - Separate and distinct levels

    - State-centered view

    - Dred Scott (1857)

    - Dual Federalism ended in 1930s (The New Deal)

- Cooperative Federalism

    - "Marbled cake federalism"

    - Solutions for state and local problems are directed and sometimes funded
      by both national and state governments

    - Administration of programs characterized by shared power and shared
      responsibility and shared blame if they fail

    - No clean divisions of power

- The textbook covers more models-- remember these definitions, but they're
  essentially variations of the cooperative model

    - Picket Fence Federalsm

        - Organized but not completely separate like dual

        - Stratified policy areas affecting both state and nat'l gov't

- Why should thefed gov't spend money cooperatively?

    - nat'l money to pay for nat'l problems and set minimal standards

    - Spillover effects

    - The national government supports state and local governments with revenue
      (helps equalize resources)

    - Programs might be managed better by state and local agencies (attack
      national problems but minimize growth of federal agencies)

    - Competitive federalism

        - Good side: states compete to attract business

        - Bad side: Cutthroat competition and race to the bottom
