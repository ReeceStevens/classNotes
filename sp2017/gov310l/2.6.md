# GOV 310 Lecture -- 2.6.17

## From last time: Cons about Federalism

- No national standards can create inequalities

- Dispersion of power can allow groups to protect interests which may be
  undemocratic and contrary to national trends

- Low visibility and information flow about local governments

- Is diversity always good? Bad competition between states

    - Some states might have differing regulations, etc.

## How do we divide power?

- National powers

    - Obligation to protect states from invasion and violence

    - Supremecy clause

    - Judges in every state must obey US Constitution

    - Other powers

        - coin money

        - regulate commerce

        - provide an army and navy

        - establish courts inferior to Supreme Court

        - establish post offices

        - Make laws necessary and proper to carry out these powers

        - admit new states

        - Nat'l gov't is the sole arm of negotiation of the US

        - Declare war

            - The last officially declared war was WWII. The rest were just
              "conflicts."

- State powers

    - Reservation clause (10th amendment)

        - "Powers not explicitly given to the national government by the
          Constitution and not prohibited by it to the states, the power is

        - legislative public health, safety, and morals of their citizens

        - State criminal laws

        - set time/place/manner of elections

        - ratify amendments to federal Constitution

        - exert powers not delegated to national government or prohibited to
          the states

        - establish local governments

        - regulate commerce within a state

        - regulate voting

- Concurrent powers

    - Powers shared by the states and the federal government

    - Powers:

        - Taxation

- Denied powers

    - Bill of Attainer

        - A law declaring something like an act illegal without a public trial

    - Ex Post Facto Laws

        - After-the-fact: A law making previous legal activty illegal and
