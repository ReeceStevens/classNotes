## Legislature

### Bicameral Legislature

- 2 houses

#### House of representatives

- Entire body elected every 2 years

- 435 reps

- all have to be at least 25 years old

- Special powers: originates all tax bills and brings impeachment charges

- Since 1789: 10,880 people have served in House and 1,963 in Senate

- Why 435?

    - At the first congress, 65 reps

    - Every census, expanded number of seats

    - Finally, in 1929 the size was fixed at 435

    - By 2012, each seat represented approximately 710,767 people

        - VAP (Voting available population) (seats are determined by this
          number)

        - VEP (Voting eligible population)

- Reapportionment

    - Every 10 years, we have a census

    - Congressional sets get redesigned to account for population changes

    - When a state gains or loses a seat, their state legislature will
      redistrict their US House of Representatives districts

- Manipulation of Districts

    - Gerrymandering

        - Districts have to be contiguous, "make sense", etc.

    - Creation of 'safe seats'

        - Seat that is so much in favor of one party over another that it is
          virtually impervious

    - Representation of minority interests

        - cracking: breaking up a "blue" area by distributing portions of it in
          lots of different "red" areas

        - packing: clump "blue" areas into one district so you only lose one
          district rather than having four or more competitive districts

        - majority-minority districts: if there's a certain proportion of
          minorities in an area, districts can be drawn that maximize advantage
          for a particular ethic group

        - *racial* gerrymandering is not allowed, but it "can be a factor in
          redistricting-- just not the primary factor"

- House leaderships

    - Speaker of the House

        - Paul Ryan

        - Speaker is often considered the leader of the party

        - Third in line for the presidency

        - Presides over the house when it's in session

        - Appoints reps to committees

        - Appoints party leaders and senior staff members

        - Directs to what committee bills will be sent

    - Formal Duties

    - Majority Party

        - McCarthy -- Leader

        - Scalise -- Whip

        - Party that has the most seats in the house

        - They control all of the committee chairs

            - Chair is the number one person for the party in power

            - The "Ranking Member" is the number one person for the party out
              of power

            - The ordering of power, or ranking, of each person is determined
              by the party

        - The role of whips:

            - named after British House of Commons where they are called the
              'whipper in' (the rider who keeps the hounds together in a fox
              hunt)

            - The whip keeps track of all the legislatures are voting. They
              have to know both physically where everybody is as well as how
              they feel about upcoming votes and try to convince them to stay
              with the party lines. They also prepare summaries of the bills.

    - Minority Party

        - Pelosi -- leader

        - Hoyer -- Whip

- Rules Committee

    - Only in the house, not in the senate

    - Regulates time the floor debate of a bill

            - Sometimes Restricted Rule (some amendments on the floor)

        - Open rule

            - There's no limit to the number of additions you can put on the
              floor
