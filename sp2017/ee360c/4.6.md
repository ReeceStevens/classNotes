## Dynamic Programming

### Weighted Interval Scheduling

From last time:

- Calculate the optimal value of a schedule with `j` jobs

    basically, do I include this last job in the schedule or not? i.e., is it
    more optimal to add this job plus the next valid latest job (vj + M[p(j)])
    or is it more optimal to not include this job (M[j-1])? If you calculate
    this from the bottom up (i.e. starting at j = 1), this will describe the
    optimal value for each level.

- Segmented least squares

    Find the fewest sequence of lines that minimizes squared error with the
    tradeoff function E + cL.

    - We have OPT(j), minimum cost for points pi-pj

    - e(i,j) = minimum sum of squares for point pi-pj.

    To compute OPT(j), last segment uses points pi-pj for some i

        - Cost = e(i,j) + c + OPT(j-1)

        - This means adding error of e(i,j), OPT(j-1), and one line to connect
          them

        OPT(j) = min(e(i,j) + C + OPT(i-1)), where 1 <= i <= j

        Bottleneck: computing e(i,j) is O(n^2)

### The Knapsack Problem (0-1 problem)

- Given `n` objects and a knapsack

- Each item has a weight and value, and you can't take fractional items

- Need to keep track of how much room is left

Define OPT(i,w) is the max profit of items 1,...i with weight limit w.

OPT(i,w) = OPT(i-1, w) if object weight is > remaining weight
OPT(i,w) = max(OPT(i-1,w), vi + OPT(i-1, w-wi)) otherwise

Essentially building out a matrix of optimal values given a certain weight
