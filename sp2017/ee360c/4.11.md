### Case Study: RNA Secondary Structure

Given a strand of RNA, what's the maximum number of base pairs you can make?

- We are defining free energy as the inverse of base pairs

- Rules:

    - A pair with U, C pairs with G

    - No sharp turns: ends of each pair must be spearated by at least four
      intervening bases

    - Non-crossing: you can't have two base pairs crossing each other

Structure

- OPT(i,j) is the maximum number of base pairs in a secondary structure of the
  substring bi ... bj

    - Case 1: If i >= j - 4,

        You can't make any bonds b/c of no sharp turns rule

    - Case 2: Baes bj is not involved in a pair

        OPT(i,j) = OPT(i,j-1)

    - Case 3: Base bj pairs with bt for some i <= t < j-4

        Creates two bounds, [i,t-1] and [t+1,j-1]

        Defines OPT(i,t-1), OPT(t+1,j-1)

        Therefore, OPT(i,j) = OPT(i,t-1) + OPT(t+1,j-1) + 1

        But what is t? Pick the max of i <= t < j-4.

- What order do we solve the subproblems in?

    - Do the shortest intervals first

    ```
    RNA(b1,...bn) {
        for k = 5 .. n-1
            for i = 1...n-k
    // See rest of slides
    }

    ```

### Recipe

- Characterize the structure of the problem

- Recursively define the value of an optimal solution

    - Think about problems from the top-down until you're going to write the
      code. Then, when you're writing, think bottom-up.

- Compute the value of the optimal solution

- Construct the optimal solution from computed information

### Coin Changing Problem

Problem: Make change with coin denominations d1,d2...dk, where d1=1.
Make an algorithm that makes chnage for an amount of money n using as few coins
as possible.

- Prove that this problem has optimal substructure

    - Exchange argument

- Let C[p] be the minimum number of coins of the k denominations that sum to p
  cents. Recursively define the value of the optimal solution. To get you
  started, there must exist some "first coin" di, where di <= p.

  `c(p) = min_{1<=i<=k}(c(p-di))+1`

  this algorithm is O(nk) (pseudopolynomial because of n)

- Provide the algorithm
