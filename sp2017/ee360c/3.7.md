## Continuing from last time: Shortest Path

Predecessor subgraph

Initialization:

- for every vertex, maintain `v.d` to be an upper estimate on the weight of the
  shortest path from `s` to `v`.

Relaxation:

- Test whether we can improve the shortest path known to `v` by going through
  `u`, and if so, updating `v.d` and `v.pi`

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Maintains a set of vertices S to which the shortest path has been determined

- Pick a new vertext `u` with the minimum shortest path estimate of those left
  in V-S to add to S.

- Then relax all of the edges leaving `u` an repeat

- Use a minimum priority queue Q of the vertices that are keyed by the `d`
  estimates.

Correctness proof by induction.
