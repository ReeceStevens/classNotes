## In Class Exercise

Prove the following:

For a BFS tree, any nonexistent edge E must be between nodes on the same or
adjacent layers. For a DFS tree, any nonexistent edge E must be connected to
its ancestor. This produces two disjoint sets of possible missing edges;
therefore, the only way a BFS and DFS tree can be identical is if the original
graph G has no edges that are excluded in either tree-- that is, the graph *is*
the tree.

## Bipartite Graphs

How do we test bipartiteness?

Things we know about bipartite graphs:

- it cannot contain odd length cycles

- No edge of G joins two nodes of the same layer and G is bipartite, OR

- An edge of G joins two nodes in the same layer, and G contains an odd-length
  cycle

## Directed Graphs

Strong Connectivity: Node `u` and `v` are *mutually reachable* if there is a
path from `u` to `v` and also a path from `v` to `u`.

A *strongly connected* graph has each pair of nodes as mutually reachable

- Lemma: G is strongly connected iff every node is reachable from `s` and `s`
  is reachable from every node
