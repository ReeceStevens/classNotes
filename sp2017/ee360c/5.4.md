# EE 360C Lecture -- 5.4.17

The last class day!

## End of last class: Clique exercise

clique -> vertex cover

Flip the graph (absence of edge -> edge). If previously we were looking for a
clique of size k, we are now looking for a vertex cover of size k. This is
because nodes within a clique will have no edges between them in the reversed
graph, requiring at least that many nodes to be in the vertex cover.

## Final Hints

Know the SAT, vertex cover, clique problems

Study hints:

- Work through the problem w/o looking at solution first

- Final will be heavily weighted towards new material, shouldn't be twice as
  long.

- Practice the NPC transformations _a lot_. Seems like this will be on the exam
