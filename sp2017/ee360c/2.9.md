# EE 360C Lecture -- 2.9.17

## Review from last time: Heaps

## Today: Graphs

### Undirected Graphs

Formalized as G=(V,E)

- V is the set of nodes

- E is the edges that exist between pairs of nodes

- Captures pairwise relationships between objects

- Graph size parameters: n = |V|, m = |E|

### Directed Graphs

- Same as undirected except that it captures *one-way* relationships between
  nodes

### Graph Representation

Two ways:

1. Collection of adjacency lists

2. Adjacency matrix

Generally, we prefer adjaceny lists

- If the graph is very *dense*, a matrix is okay to use

#### List Represenatation

- Represent graph G by an array `Ajd` of n lists, one for each vertex in V.

- Lends itself to easily adding in weighting to each edge

#### Matrix Representation

- In a list, it's difficult to determine if there's an edge from u to v. 

- Contrast: Adjacency matrix represents a graph using an n x n matrix A =
  (`a_ij`) such that `a_ij` = 1 if (i,j) has an edge and zero otherwise

- Requires Theta(n^2) memory regardless of the number of edges

    - We can use half of the storage space for an undirected graph

- Checking if an edge exists in a matrix is O(1) time

    - In a list, it's O(n)

#### In Class Exercise: Incidence Matrix

Convert an adjacency list to an incidence matrix

- Create an `n*m` matrix initialized with zeros

- For each node n in the list, for each adjacent node mark each edge in the
  matrix

- Complexity: `O(n+m)`

Convert matrix into adjacency list

- Runtime complexity: `O(n*m)`
