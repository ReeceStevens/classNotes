## Homework 6 Review

### Coin changing problem

- Always pick largest possible coin value

- Greedy isn't always best: i.e., make change of 14 with coin denominations of
  12, 7, and 1.

    - Greedy would pick 12, 1, 1

    - Fastest is 7, 7

    - Greedy doesn't work since the coin denominations aren't compositional
      (built on each other)

### Dijkstra's algorithm problem (single source shortest path)

- O(nlogn)

- Faster algorithm: DFS to find u and v, and then possibly a BFS from u if v is
  first in the tree. Ordre O(E+V), or O(N) for a binary tree since E ~= V

## Today: Minimum Spanning Trees

Find an acyclic subset of weighted edges that connects all of the vertices in V
and whose total weight is minimized.

Approach:

- Grow a set of edges `A` that will eventually ocnstitute our minimum spanning
  tree. What should our loop invariant be?

    - Prior to each iteration, ensure `A` is a subset of some minimum spanning
      tree

    - Termination condition: all nodes have been explored

- Let a *safe edge* be any edge that can be added to `A` while maintaining the
  invariant

    - At each step, we select any safe edge (u,v) and add it to `A`

Correctness proof by induction

A *cut* of an undirected graph is a partition of `V`

- An edge (u,v) *crosses* a cut if one of u and v is in S and the other is in
  V-S

- A cut *respects* a set A of edges if no edges in A cross the cut

- An edge is the *light edge* crossing a cut if its weight is the minimum of
  all the edges that cross the cut

- Claim: For any cut of G that respects A, the light edge crossing is a safe
  edge for A

Specific algorithm: **Kruskal's Algorithm**

- Builds directly on the generic-MST algorithm. At each step, looks at all
  edges connecting any two trees in the forest GA and chooses the smallest one.

    - it's a greedy algo b/c at each step, it takes the smallest of all
      possibilities

    - Use the algo for computing the connected components of a graph

    - Runtime: O(ElogE)

Other algorithm: **Prim's Algorithm**

- Chooses an arbitrary vertex and grows the minimum spanning tree from there

    - A is always a single tree

    - Prim's algo is greedy since it always picks the smallest edge that could
      grow the tree
