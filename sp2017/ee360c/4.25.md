### Capacity Scaling

Call `augment` mlog(C) times, with each call to augment being O(m). Therefore,
algorithm has running time O(m^2log(C))

- Capacity Scaling: O(m^2logC)

    - polynomial on the input

- Ford-Fulkerson: O(mC)

    - pseudopolynomial

Polynomial is always preferred over pseudopolynomial b/c top algo is scaling
with respect to the number of bits required to express C while the bottom is
scaling with respect to the value of C.

On paper, capacity scaling is almost always better. In reality, you'll want to
look at the characteristics of your input.GA

Check these proofs of runtime again, they were a bit complicated to learn on
the fly.

### Matching

Given an undirected graph, a *matching* is defined as a subset of the edges
such that each vertex is represented *at most once* in the set of edges.

Goal: Find a max cardinality matching (i.e. max number of edges)

- This is a very hard problem!

#### Bipartite Matching

- A much, much easier problem to solve

- Stable marriage problem

    - One side of bipartite graph is connected to source, other side is
      connected to sink (see graphs in slide 48)

#### Perfect Matching

A matching is perfect if each node appears in *exactly* one edge in M.

What is required for a bipartite grpah to have a perfect matching?

- *Necessary*: We must have same number of nodes in L and R

- *Necessary*: Each subset must have at least as many nodes as in the subset

- *Sufficient*: If all subsets of L have at least as many neighbors as they do
  nodes, it's sufficient to say they have a perfect match.
