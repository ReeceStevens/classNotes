## Finishing Up: Graphs

Directed Reachability

- Given a node `s`, find all nodes reachable from `s`

- In particular, we can be interested in the shortest path

Graph Searches

- Breadth-first search

- Depth-first search

- Both work with undirected or directed graphs

### Directed Graphs

Strong connectivity

- A graph in which all nodes are mutually reachable

Theorem: We can determine strong connectivity in O(m+n) time.

- Pick any node `s`, run BFS

- Run BFS from `s` in a reversed directed graph

- Return true iff all nodes reached in both BFS executions

Strong components

- The set of all nodes with respect to `s` such that `s` and the node are
  mutually reachable

Theorem: for any two nodes `s` and `t` in a directed graph, their strong
components are either identical or disjoint.

In class exercise: for each of the following, give an example directed graph
where adding a single edge:

- Decreases the number of strongly connected components.

```
    o <-> o
    ^
    | <- add an edge here
    o <-> o
```

- Maintains the number of strongly connected components

```
  o  o
   ^
   |- Add an edge here to maintain strongly connected component count

OR

 o -> o -> o
 ^  / |   /
 | L  V L
 o <- o
```

- Increases the number of strongly connected components (impossible)

### Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

A directed graph containing no cycles

Examples:

- Precedence constraints: edge (vi,vj) means vi must precede vj

Definition: nodes v1 ... vn so that for every edge (vi,vj) we have i < j

- This is also called a *topological ordering*

Lemma: if G has a topological order, then G is a DAG.

- Proof by contradiction: a directed cycle breaks topological ordering.
  Therefore, if a graph is topologically ordered, it cannot have a cycle.

Lemma: if G is a DAG, then G has a node with no incoming edges

Lemma: if G is a DAG, then G has a topological ordering

- Proof by induction

    - base case of n=1

    - DAG with n>1 nodes, find node v with no incoming edges

    - G - {v} is a DAG, since deleting v cannot create cycles

    - By inductive hypothesis, G-{v} has a topological ordering

    - Place v first in topological ordering, then append nodes of G-{v} in
      topological order.

Theorem: the algorithm finds a topological order in O(m+n) time

- Initialize count array and set of nodes with no incoming edges (O(m+n))

- Update to delete `v`: constant time.

In Class Exercise: Provide an alterantive algorithm to compoute a topological
sort that uses a DFS procedure directly.
