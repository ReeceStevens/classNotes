## Graphs: Paths and Connectivity

The Connectivity Problem: Given two nodes `s` and `t`, is there a path
between them?

The Shortest Path Problem: What is the length of the shortest path
between `s` and `t`

### Related issue: Finding connected components

```
R will consist of nodes to which `s` has a path

Initially, `R = [s]`

While there is an edge (u,v) where u is in R and v is not in R,

    add v to R
```

Theorem: upon termination, R is the connected component containing `s`

*Proof by contradiction:* Assume there exists a set `R` such that some node v
is connected to `s` but does not exist in `R`. There must be some edge where one
node `u` is connected to another node `z` that is outside of `R`. In that case,
`z` should be in `R` due to our algorithm.

### Breadth First Search

Problem: Given a graph `G = (V,E)` and a specific source vertex `s`, what
vertices can be reached from `s`?

- The basic idea is to systematically explore the edges of G to "discover" each
  node reachable from s

    - This works for both directed and undirected graphs

    - Name of BFS comes from the fact that it expands the search for new nodes
      uniformly across the "frontier" of discovered nodes

In BFS, you can think of all nodes as being colored either white, gray, or
black. Initially, all nodes are white.

- Gray nodes are the "frontier", Black nodes are already explored

- A node is discovered the first time the BFS encouters it; at this point, BFS
  colors the node gray

- The complete set of gray nodes is the "frontier"

- To proceed, BFS looks at each of the gray nodes, examines each of its
  outgoing edges to see if they're connected to any white (undiscovered)
  nodes

Fundamentally, we're dealing with layers.

```
L_o = {s}

L_1 = all neighbors of L_o

... etc.
```

Theorem: for each i, Li consists of all nodes at distance exactly i from `s`.
There is a path from `s` to `t` if and only if `t` appears in some layer.

*Proof by Contradiction*
Assume `x` and `y` are connected by edge `(x,y)`

### Depth First Search

An alternative to exploring across the entire frontier at the same time is to
explore a single path as far as it can go, then explore a different one.

```
DFS(u):
    Mark u as Explored and add u to R
    For each edge (u,v) incident to u
        If v is not marked Explored, then
            Recursively invoke DFS(v)
        Endif
    Endif
```
