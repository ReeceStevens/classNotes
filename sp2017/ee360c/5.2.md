## Proving a problem is NPC

1. X is NP (can be verified in poly-time)

2. Prove that X is NP-Hard (A <=_p_ X)

    - NP-hard problems are at least as hard as all the problems in NP

## The first NPC problem

CIRCUIT-SAT problem

- Given all the possible sets of inputs, is there some input such that the
  circuit is satisfied? i.e. is it possible for a set of inputs to produce a 1
  at the end of the circuit?

    - Practical detail: If circuit is not satisfiable, then you can just remove
      it.

SAT Problem

- Given a boolean formula with some set of inputs, can it evaluate to true?

- Proving SAT is NPC:

    1. SAT is in NP

    2. CIRCUIT-SAT <=_p_ SAT

## 3-SAT

CNF: conjunctive normal form

- It's a bunch of clauses that are ANDed together, but inside each clause there
  are only ORs.

    - i.e. (x v y v z) ^ (a v b v c)

3-SAT means that it's a CNF with at most three inputs in each clause

Proof of NP-Completeness

1. 3-SAT is NP

    - Since 3-SAT is a subset of SAT, we know it's NP

2. SAT <=_p_ 3-SAT (3-SAT is at least as hard as SAT)

    - Every boolean formula can be rewritten as a 3-term CNF

        - Build a parse tree for the boolean formula

        - use demorgan's law to flip disjunctive clauses to conjunctive clauses

        - Proof is in the slides

## CLIQUE problem

Does G have a clique of size k? (a group of strongly connected nodes)

Proof of NPC:

1. Clique is in NP

    - Verify that the set has size k

    - verify that every node is connected to every other node in the set

2. Prove that clique is NP hard

    - 3-SAT <=_p_ CLIQUE (3-SAT is polynomial time reducable to CLIQUE)

        - Map an arbitrary instance of 3-SAT to an instance of CLIQUE

        - phi = (a v b v c) ^ (d v e v f) ^ (g v h v i) = C1 ^ C2 ^ ... CK

        - Create a node for each literal. In each clause, a node should be
          connected to all nodes outside of its clause unless the other node is
          a negation of the first

        - If you can find a clique of size k, you've got a satisfiable
          equation.

    - **We will be expected to be able to perform reductions like this**

## In class exercise

Prove vertex cover is NP complete by reducing from clique (i.e. reduce from
clique)

Inputs of clique: nodes and a clique size k

For a generic instance of clique, transform to an instance of vertex cover

A generic instance of clique:

    Graph with N nodes, looking for a clique of size K
