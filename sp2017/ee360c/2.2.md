From last time... Asymptotic runtime bounds

    - Big O

    - Big Omega

## Small o-Notation

Small o defines upper bounds that are *not* asymptotically tight.

- i.e. 2n = o(n^2), but 2n^2 != o(n^2)

## Small omega notation

Small omega refers to lower bounds that are *not* asymptotically tight.

## In Class Exercise

Assume you are given functions f and g such that f(n0 = Omega(g(n)). For each
of the following proposition, give either a proof or a counter example.

- log(f(n)) = Omega(log(g(n)))

  False. Let f(n) = 1, g(n) = 2.

  log(f(n)) / log(g(n)) = log(f(n) - g(n)) for n -> infinity,

- 2^f(n) = Omega(2^g(n))

  False if f(n) = n, g(n) = 2n

- (f(n))^2 = Omega((g(n))^2)

  True, f(n)^2 > c^2 g(n)^2
