## Today: NP-Completeness

NP problems are a class of problems for which the solution can be verified in
polynomial time, but it may not necessarily be true that a solution can be
found in polynomial time.

NP-Complete problems are the hardest class of problems in NP, and so far nobody
has found a poly-time solution to any of them. All NPC problems are equivalent
to each other by reducing.
