# BME 371 Lecture -- 1.18.17

We won't typically have lecture (yay!)

## Course Expectations

- Expect this to be a challenging course. If you're idle, it's probably a red flag.

## Proposals

- Look at it as a checkpoint or milestone. Look over Suggs comments

- Dr. Tunnell's thoughts:

    - White paper, "How to write a design report" (in Files or Assignments)

    - Structure of a report

        1. Background of the problem

            - Definition of problem

            - Needs statement

            - Quantitative specifications

        2. Solution

            - Include figures!

        3. Evaluation

## Logistical Things

- Key assignments:

    1. First prototype due Feb. 10th (D:)

        - You want to get data from your prototype. View it as an experiment

        - Prototype will be assessed by TA during weekly meeting

    2. Design Review (Oral presentation + written component)

        - Oral portion is week before Spring break (30 minutes long)

        - Written is a week and a half afterwards

    3. Final Design Report (Oral and written component)

        - Hour long presentation, sponsor is present

        - Written document is due first day of finals


- How Dr. Tunnell Grades Papers

    - Ehh, just look at the rubric on Canvas
