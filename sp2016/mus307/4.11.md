Review (Coltrane)
--

1950's/Giant Steps 
-
	"Trinkle, Tinkle" (Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane, 1957)
		- Worked with Monk while on a break from 1st great quintet
		- Big contrast between Monk's playing (restrained) and Coltrane (sheets of sound)
		- AABA
	"Blue Train" (Blue Train, 1958)
		- Trumpet, Trombone, alto sax front line
		- Hard bop (backbeat, call-and-response), blues form
	"Giant Steps" (Giant Steps, 1959)
		- Rapidly moving and unusual chord progression
		- Became an etude for jazz studies, progression is very difficult to improvise over

Modal (1960's)
-
	"India" (Live at the Village Vanguard, 1961)
		- Influence of India Classical Music
		- Use of the Tanpura (basic drone instrument, 4 strings tuned and plucked with fingers)
	"Impressions"
		- same chord progression and AABA structure as "So What" (but much more high energy)
		- solos over single chord 
	"A Love Supreme"
		- four parts: Acknowledgement, Resolution, Pursuance, Psalm
		- reflection of Coltrane's reliance on God to kick his drug habits, lifestyle

Free (1960's)
-
Social Aspects:
	Little to no structure or form
	Little or no harmonic structure
	"noise factor" emphasis on texture
	Soloist developed individual styles
	Traditional rhythm section roles abandoned
	sections in melody w/o established beat or tempo
	There was a connection btwn civil rights movement freedom and freedom from conventional music form
	Songs:
	- "Father Son and the Holy Ghost" (Meditations, 1965)
		simple melody stated by tenor sax
		noise factor opening
		collective improvisation
		no real rhythm established by rhythm section, rejected in favor of creating a texture
	- "Ascension"
	- "Mars" (Interstellar Space, 1967), wasn't released till '74
		Completely improv
		Coltrane on tenor sax and hand bells; Rashied Ali on drums, percussion

Ornette Coleman (alto sax)
--
Born in Ft. Worth, TX
His music pushed jazz musicians to play more and more abstract
Approach to improv wasn't as structured as bebop and hard bop musicians
Didn't always follow the chord progressions
Early career with rhythm and blues bands
travelled to LA in 1950's
Remember the social aspects of free jazz (above)
Songs:
	- "When Will The Blues Leave" (Something Else, 1958)
		Instrumentation similar to a Hard Bop group (includes piano)
		Conventional jazz improvisation 
			(Coleman hasn't yet fully broken out of traditional jazz form)
	- "Congeniality" (The Shape of Jazz to Come, 1959)
		Tempo changes in the meolody signal Coleman's shift in the approach 
			and function of the rhythm section
		Full stops and rhythm shifts throughout the presentation of the melody
		(really cool)
	- "Lonely Woman" (The Shape of Jazz to Come, 1959)
		Bass and drums play a steady rhythm that seems unrelated to the melody
		Quick rhythm section but slow melody
	- "Free Jazz part 1" (Free Jazz, 1960)
		pretty much no structure beyond some unison melodies and distinct solos by individuals	
		37 minutes long...
		Map:
			0:06: Unison melody: 7 groupings of notes (bass clarinet solo)
			5:11 Unison melody: repeat followed by collective improvisation
			9:42 Unison melody: consisting of 14 groupings of notes followed by a more traditional melody
			25:10 short unison melody followed by bass solo, drum solo
			36:30 unison melody ending
