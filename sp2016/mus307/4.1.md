Free/Fusion
-
Free Jazz: style of music moving away from established conventions of form, rhythm, and adherence to fixed chord changes
Fusion Jazz: improvised music that is a mixture of funk and rock rhythms. Often includes electronic instruments.
Songs of the Time:
	- "Voodoo Child" Jimmy Hendrix, '60s
	- "Thank You (Falentinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" Sly and the Family Stone
Miles pulled inspiration from this new style of music
	- "Call It Anything"
		Miles just improvises the heck out of stuff
		Triggers start of melody with 2-note sign
	- "Stuff", Miles in the Sky, 1968
		Still the second great quintet, electric keys and bass
Album: Bitches Brew, 1970
	The major switch for Miles
	Lots of electric players, large ensemble
	Use of multitracking (different recordings being put together)
	use of funk, R&B, and rock rhythms
	some critics don't consider this album "jazz"
	Songs: 
	- "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down"
		rhythmic feel influenced by rock
	- "Bitches Brew"
		use of multitracking, influenced by rock and pop
		drug use inspired? very psychadelic
		more representative of "free jazz"
