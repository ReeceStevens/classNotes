Miles Davis
-
Recorded album "Birth of the Cool" in '49, but released '57
limited group performances; reaction to fast tempos and high energy of bebop
nonet (9 piece instrumentation) influence of big band era
classical music influence with an emphasis of subtle interplay between instruments
Started as a "reading band" in the 40's
Miles's trumpet playing style fit well with this style
Songs (all from Birth of the Cool, released '57):
    - "Bopblicity": trumpet, alto sax, drums, bass + a whole lotta others.
        french horn, tuba, trombone, baritone sax, piano
    - "Moon Dreams": ABACC form, same crazy instrumentation
        Mysterious sounding but still laid back. Very cool song.
        Very relaxed rhythm section
    - "Jeru": Restrained, passive solos and melodies using middle registers

-
Played bari sax on all the arrangements in "Birth of the Cool"
began working in '46, mostly was an arranger
