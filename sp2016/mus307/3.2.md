		very racially charged during time at cotton club (jungle theme was insulting to the black performers)

			solos by Bubber Miley (trumpet) and Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton (trombone)
		- "Ko Ko" '40, depiction of Congo Square in New Orleans
			Harry Carney ( bari sax) and Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton (trombone)
			Beginning to write pieces that don't contain blues progression and only loosely comply with AABA form
			Starting to think more compositionally; makes him unique among his contemporaries
	2. Standards 
		Most popular dance songs, generated most of his revenue
		Most often played by jazz musicians, typical variations of blues and AABA
		Songs:
		- "Don't get around much anymore" '40

			Johnny Hodges (alto), Cootie Williams (trumpet), "Joe Nanton (trombone)
		- "In a mellow tone", '39

	3. Mood Music
