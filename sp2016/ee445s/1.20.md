EE 445S Lecture -- 1.20.16
==

Dr. Evans
	OH: 1 hour before lecture, right outside room
	Coffee Hours: Friday 12-2 PM :D -- cafe medici
	
Midterms
-
I - 3.7.16
II - 5.2.16

Lab
-
3 hours, use that time to collect all your data
Ouside of lab, do data analysis and lab report

Homework assignments due on Friday

Implementation Complexity
-
How do we measure it?
	- multiplications (per second, total, etc)
		- more complex than addition (usually), so we use it over addition
		- sometimes can be "multiplication-additions"
		- usually 2x to 3x more complex than addition; that disappears in floating point
	- Execution time - in seconds or in cycles
	- Power consumption (important for power costs and cooling issues, also battery life)
		- past 10W, you need a fan
	- Memory: what can you fit on the processor?
		- very limited memory in embedded space 
		- RW speed. How long does it take to access memory?
		- must keep up with external streams of input data
	- Physical area and volume
For this class:
	Multiplications/s, Execution time, memory footprint, and IO rates
	we will focus on quantifying these elements

Signal Quality
-
How do we quantify it?
	- signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
		- signal power / noise power
		- higher value -> better signal
		- 10log(SNR) -> SNR in dB
	- Application Dependent parameters
		- bit rate (comm. systems)
			= B log_2(1+SNR) 
			where B is bandwidth
				  SNR is linear units
		- coverage area (wireless systems)
