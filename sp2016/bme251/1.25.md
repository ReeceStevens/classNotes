BME 251 Lecture -- 1.25.16
==
Four professors, four topics
	Dr. Xie -- Biopotentials
	Dr. Dunn -- Ultrasound/Imaging
	Dr. Suggs -- Biomaterials
	Dr. Baker -- Transport

Should go through the syllabus:
	- different role assignments for each lab module
	- team submissions for everything (nooOOOOOOO)
	- presentations

Can't cover all the material in lecture, so we have to learn the material thru canvas...

Each module is two lab classes and then a presentation. We are group 2. 
	(except transport)

Each group member has specific roles assigned to them. 80% of your grade is your role, then 20% for the other two roles.
