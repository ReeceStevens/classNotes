Gut Microbe and Immune Response
-
Outline
	- Overview of Gut Microbiome
	- Host-Microbiome Ecosystem
	- Immune Milieu 
	- Role of Gut Microbiome in Diseases

Microbiomes
-
We are trying to understand how they shape gut health
Antibiotics don't usually work so well for pathogenic strands of bacteria, since
	they've developed resistance
	- recurrent infection -> good microbes killed, bad microbes survive

Terminology
-
- Microbe: Microorganism, a microscopic living organism (including prokaryotes and eukaryotes)
	Virus: not considered living b/c cannot independently replicate
	Bugs: slang for microbes
- Microbiome: the collective genomes of the microorganisms that reside in an environmental niche
- Microbiota: ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, or pathogenic microorganisms that share	
	the body space (microbiome and microbiota are largely synonymous
- Microbial community (microbial consortium): all microbial populations in a habitat (spatial niche)

Number of Genes in Human Microbiome
-
Bacteria: ~8 Million
Human cells: ~22,000
Huge amount of complexity, still understanding gene abundance
	Human Microbiome Project (HMP)
		- Characterize the abundance, diversity, and functionality of genes present in all microorganisms
			that live in the different sites of the human body
		- Jeff Gordon is the head of the project

Lifetime dynamics of a gut micribiome
-
Changes throughout lifetime
When unborn, gut is essentially sterile
Breastfeeding and formula start to seed the microbial population necessary to start the microbiome
	breastfeeding -> much better microbial population development over time
Early on, large population of proteobacteria
As growing older, firmicutes grow more prominent

Major three Phylums of Bacteria in the Gut
--
Bacteroidetes (gram negative)
-


Firmicute (Gram Positive)
-
Some possible pathogenic strains, but most are deeply involved in training the immune system 

Proteobacteria (gram negative)
-
Lots of recognizable pathogenic strains here. If population of proteobacteria is increased, it's a warning
sign that something isn't right.

The Body's Host-Microbe Ecosystem
-
Microbe system not restricted to the gut
Critical microbe ecosystems: hands, oral/genital tracts, belly button
Microbiomes can also be transferred (i.e. you share a biome with your pet)

16S rRNA: typically stable in all populations of bacteria
	can sequence it in order to identify individual species inside a microbiome
	Historically, we viewed bacteria from the culturing method (isolating single species)
	Breakthrough: Carl Woese tried to use just specific genes (i.e. 16S sequencing)
		We can only culture ~1% of the microbes in the gut; we don't know how to culture 99%
	Next advancement: high-throughput sequencing for the entire genome

Taxonomic Distribution of Microbes
-
Placenta and uterus also have microbiomes, not sterile
	We don't know exactly how these populations are maintained and regulated
	why does fetus not get an infection?

Intestinal Microflora
-
Population size increases exponentially as you move downward
	10^2, 10^3 in stomach
	10^4-5 in small intestine
	10^3-7 in Ilium
	10^9-12 in Colon
Total number: 10-100 Trillion
Diversity: 500-1000 species
>70% are unculturable
obligate anaerobes are dominant in the gut microbiota
	break down polymers that humans can't digest
	resistance to pathogen colonization (niche competition)

Probiotics, Prebiotics, Synbiotics
-
these bacteria digest things that we can't digest ourselves

Gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and Peyer's Patch
-
Lymphoid structures and aggreagates associated with the intestinal mucosa, specifically the Peyer's 
	patches and lymphoid follicles
GALTS are enriched in conventional and unconventional lymphocytes and specialized dendritic cells 
	and macrophage subsets
GALTS provide the first line of defense to entry of pathogens across the mucosal barrier
Peyer's patches found mainly in the distal ileum, have the structure of lymphoid follicles containing
	B, helper T, dendritic cells, and macrophages

M Cells sample luminal contents
-
Primary purpose: take luminal antigens inside the submucosa
	form a kind of communication between lumen and inside
	M cells are just a gateway, they don't trigger the immune system directly (that we know of...)
Microfold (M) cells are found in the GALT of the Peyer's patches
	Lack mirovilli on the largely fenestrated apical membrane with a thinner glycocalyx coating
	Don't secrete mucus or digestive enzymes
	function to interact directly with luminal antigens in the gut
	can take up antigens via endocytosis into the GALT
	Some pathogens may gain entry via M cells (i.e. salmonella, shigella)
Why would the M cells allow salmonella and shigella in?
	M cells have specialized endocytosis process for entry of luminal contents
	Some pathogenic bacteria have evolved surface molecules that bind to M cell receptors
	M cells transport those pathogens inside the body
	immune system immediately reacts with those pathogens and neutralizes them

Challenges in Gut Microbiome Study
-
Metabolic mismatches between animal cells and microbes
Outgrowth of microbes in teh absence of antiobiotics
different atmospheric conditions: aerobic vs. anaerobic
limted models for host-microbe interatciont exist both in vivo and in vitro
germ-free humanized mice are very expensive and often inefficient, functionally limited
lack of protocol for in vitro long-term co-culture

Probiotic co-culture enhances barrier functionality, but is difficult to replicate in the lab
requires constant flow, mechanical stimulation, appropriate environment for growth

Biofilm
-
Physical scaffolding and network
Mixture of living and dead bacteria
show up in mucus layer or food residues
adapted to efficiently digest insoluble polysaccharides (~20 Âµm tall)

Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME)
-
Basically a bunch of jars that simulate the digestive system

Pathology and Disease
-
Dysbiosis: a term for a microbial imbalance on or inside the body ***Know this***
	Loss of balance immediately affects health in other ways
	Disrupts balance between T_helper cells and T_regulation cells, constant state of inflammation
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
	- Dysbiosis
	- Short-chain fatty acids
	- T lymphocytes (T helper vs. T reg)
	- Leaky gut

Microbial composition dramatically changes in IBD
	Cateroides fagilis generates a thick biofilm in IBD-- opportunistic pathogen
	
In oral cavity
	Porphyromonas (gingevitis)
	Fusobacterium
