From last time...
-
Na+, K+, Cl-, and water absorption
	Most water absorbed in small intestine (7.5L per day)
		some in colon (0.5L)
	Na+ absorption happens in enterocytes and colonocytes
	Understand directions and flow of ion absorption
	Apical Side
		1. Na+ channel
		2. Na-Cl symporter
		3. Cl-HCO3 exchanger
		4. Na-H exchanger (NHE)
	Basolateral Side
		1. Cl- channel
		2. Na-K-ATPase
	K+ and water passively move through the paracellular pathway

Hepatic Portal System
-
	Intestine absorbs nutrients -> hepatic portal vein -> liver
	liver -> hepatic vein -> heart
	- This path is used by both absorbed nutrients and orally taken medicine
	- Transport of organic nutrients and ions
	- Takes place mostly in duodenum and jejunum
	- Most nutrients move into capillaries in the villi, and then from there to the hepatic portal system
	- delivery of absorbed materials directly to the liver creates a biological filter
	- Cytochrome P450 isozymes in liver metabolize xenobiotics and clear them from bloodstream before they 
		reach systemic circulation (bioavailability)

Large intestine concentrates waste
-
Sphincter muscle valve controls movement from small intestine to large intestine (ileocecal valve)
Mostly, things that are in your large intestine are the things you can't degrade yourself (need microbe friends)
Traditional view: no significant digestion of organic molecules take place in the colon
Revised view:
	numerous gut bacteria inhabiting colon breka down significant amound s of undigested complex carbohydrates and proteins through fermentation
	end products include lactate and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as butyric acid
	SCFAs are used by colonocytes as their preferred energy substrate (remember, they don't use glucose so that we can absorb it w/o attenuation)
	also produce significant amounts of absorbable vitamins like vitamin K
GI tract secretes ions and water
	ions such as Na, K, Cl, HCO3, and H are secreted into lumen, then reabsorbed
	water moves through epithelial cells via membrane channels or paracellular pathways by osmotic graidents 
	many of apical and basolateral membrane transporters of GI tract are similar to those in the renal system
	BL transporter: ubiquitous Na+-K+-ATPase
	Co-transporters: na-k-cl symporter, cl-hco3 exchanger, na-h exchanger, h-k-atpase
	ion channel

Acid secretion in the stomach
-
Parietal cells
	deep in the gastric glands
	secrete HCl into stomach lumen
	cytoplasmic pH is 7.2, so they are pumping H+ against a gradient that is 2.5 million times more concentrated in the lumen
		accomplished by active transporters (H-K-ATPase transporter)
		K-ATPase: causes K+ to enter cell, then Cl- follows H+ through open channel
	
Bicarbonate secretion in the stomach
-
Parietal cells (again)
	make bicarbonate from CO2 and OH-
	buffering action of HCO3 makes blood leaving the stomach less acidic, creating an "alkaline tide"
	Carbonic anhydrase (CA) converts OH and CO2 to bicarbonate
		-> HCO3 ions are pumped out to ECF from cytoplasm of parietal cells by the basolateral Cl-HCO3 exchanger
		-> Cl- are absorbed by Cl-HCO3 exchanger
	Net result: immediately after a meal, blood pH goes up as stomach pH goes down

Secretory cells of the gastric mucosa
-
Mucous neck cell
	Generate mucus and bicarbonate
	mucus: serve as a physical barrier btwn lumen and epithelium
	bicarbonate: buffers gastric acid to prevent damage to epithelium
Parietal cells
	Generates gastric acid and intrinsic factor
	gastric acid: activates pepsin; kills bacteria
	intrinsic factor: complexes with vitamin B12 to permit absorption
Chief cells
	Generates pepsinogen and gastric lipase
	pepsinogen: digests proteins
	gastric lipase: digests fats
Enterochromaffin-like cells
	generates histamine
	histamine: activates gastric acid production in parietal cells

Mucous-bicarbonate barrier
-
200-300 um thick
insulates from low-pH stomach lumen
at cell surface, pH is 7

Intgration of cephalic and gastric phase secretion
-
see slide diagram

Exocrine and Endocrine in Pancreas
-
Sphincter of Oddi (gateway from pancreas to duodenum
	About 2L a day output
Duct cells secrete NaHCO3 into digestive tract
Acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes
Pancreatic acini form the exocrine portion of the pancreas

Difference btwn exocrine and endocrine
	exocrine -- enzymes and chemicals, delivered to duct
	endocrine -- mostly release hormones directly into capillaries

Exocrine in Pancreas
-
Pancreas is unencapsulated (no outer layer)
	very sensitive to mechanical damage
exocrine system puts salts and enzymes into the duodenum
Major secretions:
	- bicarbonate
	- amylase
	- lipase and colipase
	- protease
	- other enzymes

Endocrine in Pancreas
-
Release hormones into the bloodstream
Pancreatic islets or islets of Langerhans (usually more than 10e6 isletes per pancreas)
Surrounded by afferent and efferent arterioles
alpha-islet cells (10-20%): break down glycogen into glucose via glucagon production
beta-islet cells (65-80%): produce insulin to build up and store glycogen from glucose --> cells that are damaged in type I diabetes
delta islet cells (3-10%): produces somatostatin, a regulatory hormone that inihibits the action and release of many active hormones
Pancreatic islets are the only source of insulin and glucagon
Insulin secreteion is stimulated by increased blood glucose
glucagon secretion is stimulated by hypoglycaemia

Gastrointestinal Enteroendocrine cells
	- K Cell (produces incretin): inhibit gastric acid secretion, stimulate insulin release
	- L cell produces glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1): stimulate insulin release
	- I cell produces cholecystokinin (CCK): stimulate bile secretion and pancreatic exocrine secretion
	- G cell produces gastrin: stimulate gastric acid secretion
	- Enterochromaffin cell produces serotonin and histamine: stimulate gastric acid secretion
	- Enterochromaffin-like cell produces histamine: stimulate gastric acid secretion
	- S cell produces secretin: stimulate pancreatic exocrine (bicarbonate) secretion, inhibit gastric motility

Cl- secretion by intestinal and colonic crypt cells and salivary glands
-
	Active transporter:
		Na-K-ATPase
	Cotransporter:
		- Na-K-Cl symporter
	Ion channel:
		- Cl- channel
	Chloride ion secretion process
		1. Na, K, Cl ions enter cells by indirect active transport
		2. Cl leaves the apical side through a CFTR channel to the lumen
		3. Na+ is reabsorbed by active transporters (Na-K-ATPase)
		4. Negative Cl- in the lumen attracts Na+ by the paracellular pathway

Bicarbonate secretion in the pancreas and duodenum
-
Cotransporters:
	- Na-K-Cl symporter
	- Cl-HCO3 exchangers
	- Na-H exchanger
Active transporter:
	- Na-K-ATPase
Bicarbonate ion secretion
	1. highlevels of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the cytoplasm
	2. bicarbonate produced from CO2 and water via CA
	3. Cl- ions entered from both AP and BL into cells leave via CFTR channel
	4. Some fourth step I couldn't catch before he moved the slide..........

Integration of gastric and intestinal phases
-
Chymoe moving into duodenum triggers neural and endocrine reflexes that
	1. initiate enzyme and bicarbonate secrtiton
	2. feed back to slow gastric digestion and emptying
	3. feed forward to start insulin secretion

Secretions in the Liver
--
Liver secretes bile
-
common hepatic duct takes bile made in the liver to the gallbladder for storage
gallbladder stores about 60 mL
common bile duct takes bile from the gallbladder to the lumen of the small intestine
Hepatic artery 
hepatic portal vein
sphincter of oddi

Bile 
-
Bile is a non-enzymatic solution secreted from hepatocytes, or liver cells
each day, 600 mL of bile is produced
Secretion:
	1. bile salts made in liver, secreted through common hepatic duct
	2. bile salts pass through cystic duct to the gallbladder
	3. cholecystokinin (CCK) contracts gallbladder
	4. stored bile moves toward dodenum via common bile duct
	5. After fat emulsification, bile salts/fat complex are absorbed in ileum (lymphatic lacteal)

Bile salts facilitate fat digestion
-
Primary steroid bile acids are synthesized in the liver
bile acids conjugated with amino acids to form bile salts
95% of bile salts are reabsorbed

Specialized cells secrete mucus
-
Mucus is a viscous secretion composed primarily of glycoproteins collectively called mucins
primary functions of mucus: protective coating over GI mucosa, lubricating the contents
Mucus is made in exocrine cells:
	mucous cells in stomach 
	seous cells in salivary glands
	goblet cells in intestine

Long and short reflexes of the cephalic and gastric phases of digestion
	sight, smell, and taste of food initiates long reflexes that prepare the stomach for the arrival of food
