GI Tract
-
Has four layers:
	1. Mucosa (inner, facing lumen)
	2. Submucosa
	3. Muscluraris externa (layer of smooth muscle)
	4. Serosa (covering of connective tissue)
Crypt vs. Gastric glands:
	both serve analagous purposes for intestine and stomach, respectively
	contains stem cells
		in crypt, only at very bottom; in gastric glands, anywhere in the structure
***Textbook has incorrect stem cell location in crypt, don't be fooled***

Muscularis Externa and Serosa
	Contraction of the circular muscle layer decreases the diameter of the lumen
	Contraction of the longitudinal muscle layer shortens the tube
