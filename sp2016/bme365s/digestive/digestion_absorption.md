Project Note
-
DUE 5 PM on April 19th, 2016
... so that means you really should start it.
Must submit a group to the LA (skhot12@utexas.edu Sharwin or pri1620@gmail.com Priyanka)
	cc all group members in this email, LA will make the group in Canvas

GI Tract
-
Has four layers:
	1. Mucosa (inner, facing lumen)
	2. Submucosa
	3. Muscluraris externa (layer of smooth muscle)
	4. Serosa (covering of connective tissue)
Crypt vs. Gastric glands:
	both serve analagous purposes for intestine and stomach, respectively
	contains stem cells
		in crypt, only at very bottom; in gastric glands, anywhere in the structure
***Textbook has incorrect stem cell location in crypt, don't be fooled***

Muscularis Externa and Serosa
	Contraction of the circular muscle layer decreases the diameter of the lumen
	Contraction of the longitudinal muscle layer shortens the tube
	Inner layer has circular muscles that squeeze bolus down the digestive system
	Outer layer has longitudinal muscles
		Step 1: contraction of circular muscles behind bolus mass
		Step 2: contraction of longitudinal muscles ahead of bolus mass
		Step 3: contraction of circular muscle layer forces bolus mass forward
	
GI smooth muscle exhibits different patterns of contraction
	Migrating motor complex (MMC)
		housekeeping function that sweeps food remnants and bacteria out of upper GI tract and into large intestine
	Peristalsis
		progressive waves of conrcation that move from one section of GI tract to the next
	Governed by hormones, paracrine signals, and autonomic nervous system
Most GI tract is composed of single-unit smooth muscles with groups connected by gap junctions

Slow Wave Potentials
	Cycles of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation --> depolarization and repolarization waves known as slow-wave potentials
	3-12 waves/min in duodenum
	when slow wave potentiasl exceed threshold, voltage gated Ca2+ channels in the muscle fiber open --> Ca2+ enters --> cell fires AP --> contraction
	Longer the duration of the slow wave, the more APs fire, greater the contraction force in the muscle

Carbohydrates are absorbed as *monosaccharides*
	Intestine can only absorb monosaccharides, so everything must be broken down to be digested
	Ex: Splenda -- artifical sweetener. Can't be digested, but research shows it increases population of bad bacteria in gut
	Amylase (from pancreas) breaks long glucose polymers into smaller chains and maltose
	Interstinal brush border enzymes (disaccharidases: maltase, sucrase, lactase): break down into glucose, fructose, and galactose.
	
Carbohydrate Absorption Process
	- Glucose/Galactose: *Apical* sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) and *basolateral* GLUT2 transporter (faciliated diffusion)
	- Fructose: Apical GLUT5 transporter (facilitated diffusion) and *something else, didn't have time to grab it off of the slides*
	Enterocytes don't use glucose as their primary energy source; they just pass glucose through, don't use any
		Use glutamine instead so that glucose can pass through
		Short-chain fatty acids (i.e. butyrate) are also major energy sources for intestinal epithelium
	
Nucleic acids are digested into bases and monosaccharides
	DNA and RNA are a small part of our diets
	Pentose sugars, bases, phosphate ions
	Pancreatic ribonuclease and deoxyribunuclease
	nucleosidases and phosphatases in brush border
	Bases absorbed by active transport while carbohydrates are absorbed by facilitated diffusion

Endopeptidase for protein digestion
	proteases are secreted as inactive proenzymes (zymogens)
	Prevent autodigestion!
		only activated in the GI tract lumen
		pepsinogen -> pepsin (stomach pH of 2)
	
Difference btwn protease, peptidease, and proteinase?
	Protease or Peptidease: general term
		Proteinase = endopeptidase (in the middle of the chain)
		Exopeptidease (on the ends of the chain)
	Proteases are not always endopeptidases

Exopeptidase for protein digestion
	Aminopeptidase (found in brush border)
	Carboxypeptidase (found in pancreatic juice)

Zymogens revisited
	Pepsinogen is activated by HCl, transformed to pepsin (stomach)
	Trypsinogen activated by enteropeptidase --> trypsin (intestine)
	Chymotrypsinogen activated by trypsin --> chymotrypsin (intestine)

Protein digestion results
	- free amino acids, dipeptides, tripeptides
		all of these absorbed by mucosa
	Most free amino acids are carried by Na+-dependent cotransport
	di- or tri- peptides are absorbed by oligopeptide transporter PepT1 via H+ dependent cotransport
	some oligopeptides digested by cytoplasmic peptidases
		smaller peptiedes carried intact across membrane by transcytosis
	
Smaller peptides act as antigens, substances that stimulate antibody formation and result in allergic reaction
Absorption of peptides is a significant factor in development of food allergies and food intolerances
In newborns, peptide absorption takes place primarily in intestinal crypt cells b/c villi are so small, so crypts are
	well-exposed to the lumen

Example: Gluten
	mixture of proteins in wheat, barley, and rye
	gives elasticity and chewy texture
	Coeliac disease 
		chronic immune-mediated intestinal disoder caused by ingestion of gluten
		loss of villi
		autoimmune reaction
		no cure or medication except gluten-free diet
	
	Feeding infants less allergy-inducing peptides, gives gut a chance to mature
		indigestible peptide drugs

Digestion and Absorption of Fat
	Lipids: includes fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and steroids
	Fats are specifically saturated fats for the purposes of this discussion
	lipids aren't water soluble, so aqueous chyme in stomach contains a course emulsion of large fat droplets.
	Bile salts secreted by teh liver help to break down the coarse emulsion into smaller, more stable particles
	Bile acids are conjugated w/ taurine or glycine to form bile salts
		Are amphipathic in nature
		co-lipases help lipases to access fats by displacing bile salts
	can pass directly through apical membrane by diffusion due to nonpolarity
	cholesterols are transported by transporter proteins NPC1L1

Digestion and Absorption of vitamins and minerals
	dietary iron ingested as heme iron in meat
		heme iron is absorbed by an apical transporter
	Ionized iron Fe2+ is actively absorbed with H+ by apical cotransporter Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1)
	Inside the cell, heme releases Fe2+ and porphyrin enyzmatically
	Fe2+ is transported to basolateral side by ferroportin
	Hepcidin -> peptide hormone made by liver that inhibits the entry of iron into circulation by binding to ferroportin
	Calcium absorption
		Mostly occurse passively through paracellular pathways
		Hormonally regulated transepithelial Ca2+ transport takes place in the duodenum
		calcium enters the enterocyte through the apical Ca2+ channels
		Ca2+ in cytoplasm actively transported across basolateral membrane by either ca2-ATPase or by na+-ca2+ Antiporter
		vitamin D3 stimulates the synthesis of calcium binding and transporting proteins in enterocytes`
