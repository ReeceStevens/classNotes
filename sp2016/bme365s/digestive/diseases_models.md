Using a model system to understand disease in the GI tract

Quantitative Problem
-
Monoiodotryosine (MIT) -- a derivative of tyrosine
Everted Sac setup:
	Basically just flipping the intestinal tract inside-out
	Intestinal villi will be exposed to the outside
	put sac in MIT solution, keep track of how much MIT is inside and outside the sac
	MIT solution had a balanced ion content for its medium
MIT content in cells spikes and then gradually decreases
	1. Active transport; a gradient is formed even when concentrations are identical inside and out
	2. Compounds move from apical to basolateral (absorption)
	3. Transport across apical membrane is active transport
	4. Basolateral side: passive transport
Paper never mentioned anything about the possible amino acid transporters. Why?
	- Published in 1960, first apical amino acid transporters only happened in 1980's
	- Studies in the 50s and 60s revealed that peptides and amino acids are actively absorbed in the
		intestine, esp. proximal jejunum
	- Authors couldn't explain the mechanism of the transporters, but they had an idea
	- Tyrosine is a neutral amino acid that can be transported by apical transporter BoAT1 (SLC6A19)
		(transporter is Na+ dependent, Cl- independent, pH sensitive)
	- Mutations in the gene for this transporter creates Hartnup disease
		- defect with absorption of nonpolar amino acids like tryptophan
		- trypophan becomes serotonin (neurotransmitter), melatonin (circadian rhythm), and niacin 
			(component of NAD+ and nicotinamide)
		- Clinically asymptomatic when provided with a protein-rich diet

GI Transport Models
-
1. Ussing Chamber
	Mounting chamber for small intestine sample
	Mounted on pins of the serosal half of an acrylic chamber
	Ex vivo model, provides a system to measure transport of ions, nutrients, and drugs across tissues
	Intestinal barrier and transport
	Possible to study regional (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, or colon) transport
	Disadvantages: 
		- Short lifespan (<150 min)
		- Possible leakages
		- Continuous oxygenation required
		- No physical stimulation (i.e. peristalsis-like motion)
		- Low throughput, labor intensive

2. Transwell Model
	TransWell insert contains tissue in upper compartment over a microporous membrane
	In-vitro model
	Caco-2 cell monolayer (3-week culture)
	Tight juncion barrier (transepithelial electrical resistance, TEER)
	Robust, easy, low-cost, high throughput
	Disadvantages:
		- No physical motions and flow
		- Low physiological relevance
		- Limited complexity

Human Intestine Models
-
Challenge 1: Too Complex to Mimic
Challenge 2: Mechanical Dynamics
Challenge 3: Host-Microbe Ecosystem
Example Model: Biomimetic Gut-on-a-Chip
	Bioinspired Design of Human Intestine
		Microenvironment should resemble the complexity of the villi environment
		Need a basement membrane, epithelial cells, endothelium cells (for capillary walls)
		Vacuum chamber expands, contracts chamber to apply mechanical strain to cells
		Takes 3 days to culture as opposed to 21 days for transwell
		In static methods (i.e. transwell), brush border is only 5 um tall
		With the mechanical motion, brush border is elongated to 30 um
			close to the physiological level

Formation of human intestinal villi
	within 100 hrs, mechanical motion forms a villi-like epithelium

Intestinal Epithelial Differentialtion
	- Absorptive
	- mucus secretory
	- entero-endocrine
	- Paneth
Cytodifferentiation of engineered villi
Reconstituting Intestinal Physiology
	Remember the key functions here (not the numbers)
	Model system must cover these bases:
		- barrier functions
		- permeability
		- Differentiation
		- Drug metabolism
		- Mucus production
		- Absorption Area
		- Glucose Re-uptake

Human intestinal organoids
-
Can create induced pluripotent stem cells

Infection models
-
Overgrowth of Pathogenic Enteroinsvasive E. Coli (<24hrs)
Fast bacterial growth makes it difficult to develop an effective host-microbe environment in lab

Inflammation
-
Complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli
	such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants
Localized protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues
	- destroy, dilute, and wall off both injurious agent and injured tissue
Beneficial effets:
	- dilution of toxins
	- transport of drugs to the site of action
	- fibrin formation
	- delibery of nutrients and oxygen
	- stimulation of immune response
Chronic inflammation
	- All cancer stages (initiation, progression, metastasis
	- Pulmonary disease (asthma, COPD, hay fever, bronchitis)
	- Metabolic disorders (type II diabetes, fatty liver disease, renal failure)
	- Autoimmune disorders (IBD, Chron's Disease, Colitis, Lupus, M.S., Type I diabetes)

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
	Describes chronic inflammation diseases of the GI tract
	caused by various genetic, immunological, and environmental factors; detailed etiology remains unclear
	UC is ulcerative colitis, CD is Chron's disease
	CD is transmural inflammation
		very thick lumen wall

Intestinal Inflammatory Disease Model
-
Major contributors: gut microbes, epithelium, immune cells
Environmental factors: peristalsis, exogenous molecules

Chemically Induced Animal IBD Models
-
Advantages
	- resemble in important immunological and histopathological aspectss IBD in humans
	- rapid development of tissue injury
	- cost effective
	- robust responses to treatment
	- systemic responses as a living system
Disadvantages
	- Lack of other initiating factors such as genetics or innate immune response
	- Acute models rather than chronic inflammation
	- microbiota in the gut can interact with the chemicals and interfere tissue injury
	- Not identical to the human microbiota

Genetically Modified Animal IBD Models
-
Advantages
	- similarities in gene homology, immune and intestinal function, physiology
	- target-specific knokout
Disadvantages
	- species difference
	- non-identical gut microbiota
	- relatively small sample sizes

In-vitro IBD Models
-
There aren't many.
Can use transwell to introduce immune cells on the opposite side of the sample, but that's about it.

Gut injury by immune-antigen interaction
-
immune response over time can destroy villi structure
