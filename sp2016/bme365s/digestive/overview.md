Outline 
-
	- Overview of GI tract
	- Anatomy of Digestive System

Overview of GI tract
-
	end-to-end, ~4.5 m in live patient
	~9m long in a cadaver
		After death, longitudinal muscles in intestinal tract relax
	The Digestive Process
		Mouth -> Esophagus -> stomach -> small intestine -> pancreas -> liver
	
Digestive Process
-
Salivary glands (three on each side)
Esophagus
	Passes behind the liver (foremost organ in chest cavity)
Stomach
Liver, gallbladder, bile duct, Pancreas
Duodenum

Physiological challenges in GI tract
-
Autodigestion
	digestive enzymes must not digest the cells of the GI tract itself!
Mass balance in the lumen
	9L input and 9L output per day
	Exocrine glands and cells secrete 7L of enzymes, mucus, electrolytes, and water
		into the lumen every day (1/6) of body's total volume of water.
	7L secretion into lumen, 8.9 L by absorption from lumen
Repelling foreign invaders
	GI tract is completely open to the outside
	Lumen is largest area of contact between internal/external environment
	Defense mechanisms:
		- Mucus
		- digestive enzymes
		- lymphoid tissue (Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue, GALT)

Four processes of the digestive system
-
1. Digestion - chemical and mechanical breakdown of food into absorbable units
2. Absorption - Movement of material from GI lumen to ECF
3. Motility - movement of material through the GI tract as a result of muscle contraction
4. Secretion - Movement of material from cells into lumen or ECF

Anatomy of Digestive System
-
Mouth and salivary glands
	- mechanical breakdown of food by teeth and tongue (a.k.a. lingula)
	- Hydrolysis via amylase
	- taking food and making a bolus out of it

Salivary secretion
	- triggered by multiple stimuli (sight, smell, touch, thought of food)
	- soften and lubricate food for easy swallowing
	- Salivary amylase breaks down starch (amylose) into maltose
		- inactivated in the stomach by gastric acid
	- Salivary lipase degrades some fats
	- Defense mechanism
		contains Lysozyme, antibacterial salivary enzyme
		damages bacterial cell wall
		also has salivary immunoglobulins, disable bacteria and viruses
		saliva helps wash the teeth and keep tongue free of food particles

Esophagus
	- peristaltic motion, transferring bolus to esophogeal sphincter and then to stomach
	- Fibromuscular tube
	- upper esophageal sphincter: circular localization of ring-shaped muscle
	- Deglutition: the swallowing reflex

Gastro-esophogeal junction
	- diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity
	- Low Esophogeal Sphincter (LES) 
		- structure with very thick esophageal wall, not an actual anatomical sphincter
		- problems with LES -> heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disorder, GERD)
			backsplash of stomach acid past the LES

Stomach
	- Full volume: 4L <-- major role in storage
	- breaks down bolus by gastric juice (chemical), pepsin hydrolysis (biological),
		and churning (mechanical)
	- Produces Chyme -> a mixture of degredation products of bolus including enzymes and gastric juices
	- Exits through pyloric valve or pyloric sphincter
	- Helicobacter Pylori
		- causes chronic gastritis, gastric ulcers, and stomach cancer
		- first microbe to directly have link to cancer
		- may also play key role in stomach ecology
		- neutralizes the acid by producing urease, breaks down urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia
		- survives in stomach by neutralizing acid and burrowing in stomach mucus lining
	- Gastric pit
		Produces gastric acid as well as mucus
		Mucuous neck cell -> mucus
		parietal cell -> gastric acid (HCl)
		chief cell -> pepsinogen (activated in presence of HCl)

Small Intestine
	- duodenum, jejunum, and ileum
	- Where most digestion and absorption of foods takes place
	Villi
		- villus-crypt axis
			crypt lumen + extended lumen = increased surface area
			stem cells in crypt produce new epithelial cells to replace dead or damaged ones
			Most absorption occurs along villi via enterocytes (absorptive cells)
			Most soluble nutrirents enter capillary vessels; fats go to the lymphatic vessels (lacteals)
			Most fluid secretion occurs in the crypts
	- Very large surface area
	- Only the small intestine have villi!
	Duodenum
		- primary function is digestion
		- for carbohydrates, lactase (brush border) and amylase (pancreas) degrade into monosaccharides
		- for protein, peptidase (brush border) and trypsin/chymotrypsin (pancreas)
			 degrade into amino acids
		- for lipids, lipase (pancreas) degrades into free fatty acids
		- bile salts coat fat droplets to emulsify fatty foods
		- iron and calcium are preferentially absorbed here
	Jejunum and Ileum
		- Jejunum contributes primarily to absorption
			monosaccharides absorbed by secondary active transport
			amino acids absorbed by apical active transport
			fats are absorbed by diffusion
		- Ileum primarily absorbes vitamin B12 and bile salt
	
Large Intestine, colon
	- Very thick layer of mucus
	- colon takes ~16 hours to finish food digestion
	- no villi in colon
	- primary function to absorb water, Vitamin K, vitamin B12, thamine, and riboflavin
	- gut microbiota 

Gastric Motility
-
Peristaltic motion (movement) vs. Segmental contractions (mixing)
