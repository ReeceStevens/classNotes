Review for Midterm I!

Focus on bigger picture concepts
Practice exam posted but don't go nuts on it, it's an old exam from and older prof

Primary function of the lung
-
1. exchange of gas btwn atmosphere and blood
2. homeostatic regulation of body pH via retaining/excreting CO2
3. Protection from inhaled pathogens and irritating substances
4. Vocalization

Physiological Challenges
-
1. Dehydration
	internalized respiratory epithelium
2. How to exchange air between outside atmosphere and exchange surface deep in the body
	two separate components: muscle driven pump and a thin, moist exchange surface
	only dissolved gases can be utilized in the body

Ventilation and Gas Exchange
-
conducting system (airway)
alveoli, exchange surface
thorax muscles, rib cage

Respiratory tract
-
1. Trachea
	cartilage; columnar epithelium
		cilia on the apical surface (towards lumen)
			mucociliary escalator
		goblet cells -> secrete mucus

2. Bronchioles
	two primary bronchi, repeatedly branch for increased SA

3. Alveoli
	site of gas echange
	contains macrophages
	produces surfactant

Why is surfactant important?
	lowers surface tension -> increased lung compliance and thus reduces work of breathing
	example: Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS)
		premature babies w/o surfactant expend so much ATP trying to breath that they exhaust themselves to death
		surfactant normally produced around 8 months gestation.

Pleural space
	negative pressure keeps pleura drawn together and lungs in flated
		combination of outward pull of thoracic cage and inward recoil of elastic lungs -> negative pressure
	Analogy: think of trying to keep a wet paper bag inflated.

Airways warm, humidify, and filter inhaled air
	- warm to 37 C
	- maintain 100% humitidty
	- filter out materials

Other anatomy
	Muscles:
		diaphragm
		scalenes
		intercostals (external and internal)
	Sternum

Respiratory process
	Inspiration (active process)
		increase thoracic cavity volume, negative pressure created
	Expiration (passive process)
		diaphragm relaxes, volume decreases.

Pulmonary circulation is high-flow, low pressure
	lungs receive the whole output of heart at the same pace as the rest of the blood is going through the body
	low blood pressure because of low pulmonary circuit resistance
	low pressure -> less lost to interstitial fluid
		shorter the distance of the interstitial fluid, the better the gas diffuses into the fluid.

Gas laws
	Greatest hits: boyle's law
				   Dalton's law
	Resipratory volumes and capacities. Know all the names and stuff (memorize them)
	
Lung compliance
	ability of the lung to stretch
	amount of force required to change the shape of the lungs
	restrictive lung diseases -> reduce compliance (know the case studies)
		fibrotic lung disease
		inadequate production of surfactant (IRDS)

Lung elastance
	ability to resist being deformed
	
Air flow
-
these factors affect air flow:
- flow is proportional to r^4
	R ~ Ln/r^4
- Boyle's Law
- Compliance

Paracrine control of airway resistance
	Bronchoconstriction
		- allergy trigger
		- histamine trigger
	bronchodilation
		- increased CO2 in the inspired air detected
		- bronchioles relax

Neural control
	Bronchoconstriction
		- parasymathetic
		inhaling irritants -> constiction

	bronchodilation
		- sympathetic

Efficiency of breathing
-
Total pulmonary ventilation  = ventilation rate * tidal volume
Anatomical dead space (~150 mL)
alveolar ventilation (ventilation rate * (tidal volume - dead space volume))

Gas composition in alveoli
	what you would expect. more breathing, more oxygen, less CO2

Ventilation and alveolar blood flow are matched
	capillaries are collapsible to control blood flow
	dilate when P02 increases, constricts when Po2 decreases

Arteriole radius controlled by P02, bronchiole radius controlled by PCO2 (primarily)

Blood flow is always divereted to better ventilated alveoli (opposite of the systemic circulation response)

Gas Exchange and Transport
--
Causes of low PCO2
	- inspired air has low O2 content
	- ventilation is inadequate (hypoventilation)
Hypoventilation causees
	- decreased compilance
	- increased resistance
	- CNS depression due to alcohol, drugs

Diffusion problems cause hypoxia
	diffusion rate ~ surface area * concentration gradient * permeability

Lung diseases (know all the case studies and their causes)
	Emphysema (COPD)
		- pathological cascade (know it)
		- lowers elasticity
	Fibrotic Lung Disease
		- Scar tissue thickens alveolar wall
	Pulmonary Edema
		- fluid buildup in interstitial space
	Asthma
		- increased airway resistance in allergic reaction

Gas solubility also controls diffusion
	- pressure gradient
	- solubility of gas in liquid
	- temperature

Hemoglobin
-
Main carrier of O2
	only 2% of o2 is dissolved in blood
	carries 98% of oxygen in blood
Depends on PO2, acidity, and temperature

Bohr Effect
	All the factors that affect hemoglobin's affinity. 
	Just think about how you exercise and hemoglobin delivers oxygen where you need it

Maternal vs. fetal hemoglobin

CO2 transport
-
Transported in three ways
	- dissolved in blood (7%)
	- bicarbonate ion in RBCs (70%
	- bound to Hb (23%)
Hypercapnia (higher CO2) -> higher pH
	respiratory acidosis

Chemoreceptors in ventilation
	peripheral
		in aortic wall and carotid artery
		senses changes in pH and PCO2
		CO2 is the primary stimulus for ventilation changes
	central
		located in medulla, close to neurons involved in respiratory control
		monitor CSF composition and respond to changes in CO2
