Today:
	Microphysiological system (organs on a chip, enabling technologies)

FDA Process
	- "Fail as fast as possible"
	- can cost billions of dollars and over 10 years of testing
Human organs on a chip are an extension of precision medicine
	- can model a human system in an easily testable form
	- Key usage is for drug screening
	- mimic key functions of organ systems are modeled in a microfluidics chip
		- bone marrow
		- liver
		- gut
		- lung
		- heart
		- kidney
MPS (microphysiological systems)
Why microsystem?
	Most relevant size scales for biological responses occur at the micrometer scale
	Also, physiological mechanical responses happen at this same size scale
Manufactured by UV lithography or soft lithography on PDMS
Lung Models
-
two chambers separated by a flexible, porous membrane
	One side, lung cells; other side, capillary cells
	vacuum tubes mimic stretching of lungs as air passes through the top channel
	cyclical strain induces endothelial alignment
