Previously (on LOST):
	Gas laws and breathing.

Today:
	- Pulmonary ventilation and airway resistance
	- Gas exchange in the lungs and tissues
		- alveoli
		- gas solubility and diffusion
		- pathologies of hypoxia

Pulmonary Ventilation
-
Surfactant decreases the work of breathing
	decreases the pressure generated by surface tension
	secreted by type II alveolar epithelum cells
	disrupts cohesive forces between water molecules
	*Increases lung compliance*
Airway Resistance
	- Poiseuille's Law (R proportional to L * nu / r^4)
		L - length of a system (constant)
		nu - viscosity of the air (nearly constant)
			exceptions: air in a sauna or at high altitude
		r - radius of the tube in the lung
			The main parameter that can dramatically change the airway resistance
	- For most normal conditions, airway resistance is almost constant.
	- Noteable: bronchioles have ~2000x as much area as the upper airways, so their airway resistance is very small.
		- As a result, most of the resistance is generated in constriction or relaxation of the upper airways.
Bronchioconstriction (two types)
	- Driven by paracrine
		- in response to tissue damage, allergic reactions
		- mast cells excrete histamine -> bronchioconstriction
	- Driven by nervous system
		- inhaling irritants (i.e. smoking)
		- parasympathetic neuron signal -> bronchioconstriction (as a defense mechanism)
Bronchiodilation (two types)
	- Driven by paracrine
		- during expiration, CO2 levels increase
		- relaxed bronchiolar smooth muscle cells -> bronchiodilation
	- Driven by nervous system
		- Contraction of bronchiolar smooth muscle cells
		- epinephrine binds to the beta2 adrenergic receptor -> bronchiodilation (by relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle)
Efficiency of breathing
	- effectiveness of bentilation
	- the total pulmonary ventilation = ventilation rate * tidal volume
		 - normal ventilation rate for adults is 12-20 breaths per minute
		 - 12 * 500 mL = 6 L per minute
	- some air remains in the conducting airways (dead air): ~150 mL
	- alveolar ventilation is the amount of fresh air that reaches the alveoli (tidal volume - dead air)
		Even though 6L of fresh air is inhaled, only 4.2L reaches the gas exchange surface per minute.
	- Maxiumum voluntary ventilation: 125-170 L/min (yeah, it's a huge number)
		Expected maxiumum ventilation rate: 27-37 breaths/min
Ventilation types	
	Table 17.2 describes different patterns of breathing that are important

Gas composition of the alveoli
	When ventilation increases, pO2 increases and pCO2 decreases
	Usually calculated at normal ventilation rate: 4.2 L/min
	Maxium pp of O2 is 120 mmHg, normal is a little less than 100 mmHg
	Minimum pp of CO2 is 20 mmHg, normal is 40 mmHg

Ventilation and alveolar blood flow are matched
	Capillaries and bronchioles in the lungs are collapsible; therefore, capillaries can open and close to control blood flow
	Resistance of pulmonary arterioles is regulated by the oxygen content of the interstitial fluid
		Po2 high -> dilate (or at least maintained) (move oxygenated blood out to the body faster)
		Po2 low -> constrict
	Bronchiolar diameter is primarily mediated by CO2
		Pco2 high -> dilate (allow higher airflow into lungs to remove CO2)
		Pco2 low -> constrict

Example question:
	If a blood clot blocks gas exchange to one alveolus, what will happen?	
		-> bronchiole feeding that alveolus will constrict
		-> Tissue Po2 surrounding the alveolus will increase
		-> vessel feeding blood to that alveolus will constrict and divert to another vessel.

Gas Exchange and Transport (ch.18)
-
Exhange of gas is primarily by diffusion (driven by concentration gradient)
Lower alveolar Po2 decreases O2 uptake
	causes of low alveolar Po2: inspired air has low oxygen content
								alveolar ventilation is inadequate (i.e. hypoventilation)
	cause of hypoventilation:
		decreased lung compliance
		increased airway resistance
		CNS depression due to alcohol poisoning and drug overdoses

Oxygen diffusion at the alveoli
	Takes less than one second to reach equilibrium
Problems causesd by hypoxia
	- diffusion rate is proportional to surface area * concentration gradient * barrier permeability
	- Diffusion rate proportional to 1/distance^2
	Pathological conditions: decreased surface area, low diffusion barrier permeability, increased diffusion distance

Major pathogens:
	Emphysema (often called "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" (COPD)
		- decrease of alveolar surface area by destruction of alveoli
		pathological cascades: smoking -> smoke chemicals (such as tar) irritate the alveolar cells
							-> activates alveolar macrophages -> releases elastase and other proteolytic enzymes
							-> destroy elastic fibers of the lung -> induces apoptosis -> breakdown of alveolar wall
							-> low-elastic recoil lung -> decreased surface area
	Fibrotic lung disease
		- walls of alveoli have hardened and slows gas exhange
		cascade: scar tissue thicken the alveolar wall -> slow diffusion through scar tissuea
	Pulmonary Edema
		- increase in lung diffusion distance
		- increase of fluid content in interstitial space increases diffusion distance between alveolus and blood vessel.
		- Fluid also can build up inside the alveoli as well
		- Po2 is normal in the alveoli but low in the blood vessel b/c o2 doesn't diffuse well across water.
	Asthma
		- increased airway resistance
		- inflammation of the bronchioles (bronchiolconstriction)
		- Po2 inside the alveoli is very low
		- inducers: acetylcholine, histamine, substance P, and leukotrienes.
		- reducers: beta2 agonists, leukotriene agonists

Diffusion Laws (Fick's Laws)
-
Most important factor in lung diffusion is concentration gradient.
Gas-liquid transport is proportional to three factors:
	- pressure gradient of the individual gas
	- the solubility fo the gas in the liquid
	- temperature
Note: in a beaker of water, Po2 will be the same in the air and liquid, but the concentrations will be different
	  due to the poor diffusion of oxygen in water.
Typically, we describe dissolved gases as:
	[gas] = alpha*Pgas
	where alpha is the diffusion constant (given) and Pgas is the partial pressure of the gas
Red blood cells carry the oxygen (98%)
	(~2% comes from plasma)
