Respiratory Physiology Overview
-
Human respiration
	exchange CO2 for O2
	Two phases
		Inspiration
		Expiration
	Primary Capability of lung
		Surface area
			- Lungs have a gas exchange surface of about 75 m^2
			- Caused by branching anatomy of lungs
	Challenges
		- Dehydration
			Solution: internalized respiratory epithelium
		- How to exchange air between atmosphere and exchange surface deep within body
	 		Solution: two separate components: muscle driven pump and a thin, *moist* exchange surface
	Moisture is important because *only dissolved gases can be utilized in the body*	

	Primary functions of lung
		- Exhange of gasses btwn atmosphere and blood
		- Regulation of pH by selectively retaining or excreting CO2
		- Protection from inhaled pathogens and irritants
		- Vocalization	

	Primary purpose of oxygen: ATP synthesis

Structure of Lung and Thoracic Cavity
-
Adam's Apple: covers larynx (voice box)
Each lung lobe has three divisions: upper, middle and lower lobe
Structure is slightly different on left lobe due to cardiac notch (it's where the heart fits in)
Diaphragm holds everything together and serves as the driving force for respiration
All of this is contained in the thoracic cavity

External intercostals and internal intercostals muscles surround the rib cage and thoracic cavity

Nose serves as a filter system (nose hair for large particles, mucus for small particles)
No filter system through your mouth... so don't be a mouth-breather.

How does the respiratory system distinguish between air and food during intake?
	- Epiglottis: covers the larynx.
		triggered by the tongue, which pushes down during swallowing and closes the epiglottis

Pleural sacs enclose the lungs and serve as a membrane surrounding the lungs.
	membrane is full of pleural fluid (kind of like a water-filled balloon surrounding an air-filled balloon
	spreading 25-30 mL of water over the surface of a 3L bottle
	creates a moist, slippery surface so the lungs can move within the thorax.
	Pleural fluid holds the lungs tight against the thoracic wall

Airway
-
Should be warm, humidified, and filtered.
	- warms air to body temp (37 C)
	- Maintain 100% humidity to prevent drying out lung epithelium
	- filter out foreign materials
Epithelial cells
	- Ciliated epithelium
	- submucosal glands secrete saline and mucus -- Goblet cells
	- columnar structure
	- Cilia drive the mucus upward to the nasal cavity ("mucus elevator", or mucociliary transport)
Mucus
	- generated by goblet cells
	- consists of mucin, a highly glycosylated peptide
	- mucus that reaches the pharynx is swallowed
	- contains immunoglobulins that disable pathogens
	- fluid layer beneath the mucus prevents the cilia from sticking
Saline Secretion
	- These cells are highly polarized (directional) and highly differentiated
	- NKCC: Na-K-Cl Co-transporter
		1. Cl- brought in from ECF to epithelial cells
		2. Apical anion channels bring Cl- into the lumen
		3. Na+ goes from ECF to lumen by paracellular (between-cell) pathway (driven by gradient)
		4. movement of Na+ and Cl- into the lumen makes a gradient that causes water to follow
		ECF -> epithelial cell -> lumen of airway
		Some critical lung diseases occur in patients with a mutation of CFTR (cycstic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)
			CFTR is a chemically-gated channel protein (active transport via ATP)

	
Structure of Bronchi and Alveoi
-
Bronchi
	- moves from larynx to trachea, then branches off to right and left primary bronchus
	- continues to branch down to tiny bronchioles and then reaches alveoli (about 25 total branches)
Alveoli
	- arranged in clusters held together by elastic fibers and a network of capillaries
	- alveoli sac is full of empty space; it's a dead end in the air pathway
	- each alveolus is an exchange surface on the sac that allows transfer of CO2 and O2
	- the surface of the sac is covered in capillary beds
	- serve as an air-liquid interface
	- aveolar epithelial cells create a basement membrane through which gases diffuse
	- Type I aveolar epithelial cells make up 95% of surface
	- Type II is < 5% of surface
		- Interestingly, Type II cells make up about 60% of total epithelium overall
		- most are not on the surface
		- type I is best at initiating the gas exchange
		- type II produces the surfactant, reducing surface tension within alveoli (phospholipoprotein)
		- also contains alveolar macrophages for digesting foreign material
The entire membrane for the alveoli is less than 2 um.
Intestine epithelial cells are columnar, but alveoli cells are very flat squamous cells
There is no muscle in alveoli!!!
Connective tissue is full of elastin and collagen fibers, making it very elastic.
Blood vessels fill 80-90% of space between alveoli. Proximity to exchange space is critical.
Left lung has a more intensely lateral bronchus than the right lung. When breathing is difficult, right lung works more heavily.
Pulmonary circulation is high-flow, low pressure.

Bronchial Network
-
Fork 1-4: Bronchus
Fork 4-20: conducting bronchioles
Fork 21-24: respiratory bronchioles
