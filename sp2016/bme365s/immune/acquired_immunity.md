On Thursday: short guest lecture from Dr. Tae Kang from the George Georgiou Group
Should get paper grades back on Saturday

Adaptive Immunity
-
What type of cell produces antibodies?
	Activated B cells, or plasma cells
What kind of immune cell is most likely to encounter HPV in the skin?
	Only immune cells that are regularly seen in the tissue: Macrophage and dendritic cells
	In superficial layers of skin, no circulation. Only getting tissue response.
Why are the vaccinations ineffective if the person receiving them already has HPV of the type in the vaccine?
	If HPV is already inside the cells, it's kinda a moot point. The virus isn't circulating anymore, so the 
	antibodies aren't going to do a whole lot of good.
Why does a vaccine not infect a person with HPV?
	Vaccines only contain the protein capsules of virus, not the nucleic acids. No infection possible.

Development of Lymphocytes
-
Antigen:antibody::ligand:receptor
T cells -> memory cells
B cells -> effector cells
both have the same function. Produce antibodies for adaptive immune system
Lymphocyte clones
	Lymphocyte exposure to an antigen triggers clonal expansion and the immune response
	Basically, they keep cloning outward with different antigen receptors
		Once you find a match, that cell replicates a lot.
		The matched cell becomes plasma cell which secretes the antibodies
		This is why the primary immune response has a latency of about a week
	Secondary Immune Response
		Memory cells re-exposed to an antigen -> clone expands more rapidly, creating more 
			effector and memory cells
		Faster response time, shorter latency

How do B cells produce antigen-specific antibodies?
How can T cells differentiate with specific T cell receptors?

Antibodies = Immunoglobulin (Ig)
-
Y shape structure
One heavy chain, two light chains, connected by disulfide bonds
Two important regions:
	Fab region (Fragment antigen-binding region) top part of Y
		binds to antigen
		binds surface of virus-infected cell
	Fc (Fragment crystallizable region), bottom part of Y
		Binds macrophages and neutrophils, induces phagocytosis
		binds natural killer cell, induces apoptosis
		bottom of heavy chain called effector region
Size: about 20 nm
Five different types:
	1. IgM:  
		Pentomer (five antibodies joined together)
		Earliest responder; macroglobulin, 6-10% of Ig pool
	2. IgA:
		Mono, Di, or trimer
		Saliva, breast milk, tears, sweat, urinary tract, gut, respiratory tract
	3. IgG:
		150 kDa. 75% in body, 45% in blood
		smallest size
		15% of total serum protein, half life of 23 days
		Macrophage, neutrophils bind to IgG, activate complement
	4. IgE:
		Targets for parasites, allergens
		activate mast cells or basophils to release histamine
	5. IgD:
		Found on the surface membrane of B cells
		Function not well defined yet
Focusing on IgG
	Opsonization
		Act as opsonins to tag antigens for phagocytosis
	Agglutination
		Cause antigen clumping and inactivation of bacterial toxins
		Region of antigen that binds to antibody: epitope? couldn't really hear
	Placental Transfer
		only immunoglobulin that can pass through placenta from mom to baby
		Transfer is facilitated by IgG receptor on placenta
		Expressed for 3-4 months during the pregnancy
		IgA also can be transferred via breastmilk
	Antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity
		Antibodies bind antigens on the surface of target cells
		NK cell CD16 Fc receptors recognize cell-bound antibodies
		Cross linking of CD16 triggers degranulation into a lytic synpase
		Tumor cells die by apoptosis
		Side note:
			Cluster of differentiation (CD) is a protocol used for identifcation and investigation of cell 
			surface molecules, providing targets for immunophenotyping of cells
			Ex: CD34+, CD31- does express CD34 but not CD31
			If there's no plus or minus, it means it isn't always there; but it could be!
			All leukocyte groups have CD45+
			Natural killer cells all have CD16+
	Immunophenotyping
Back to Antibody Structure
	Variable region and Constant region
	VDJ Recombination leads to the antibody diversity
		Variable region, Diversity segment, Joining segment, Constant region
	***check these slides later***
	Can create upwards of 10^15 different antibodies
B cell development and differentiation
T cell development and differentation
Antigen presentation to T cells

Immunologic Memory
	First time adaptive immune system is activated by antigen
		Build up a clone of B cells and T cells
		Takes about a week, and after infection is over most die off
		some remain as memory cells
	Second time adaptive immune system is activated by that antigen
