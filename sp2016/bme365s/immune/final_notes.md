Notes for Exam 4
=================

Types of Leukocytes
==

Basophils
-
- Rare in circulation
- Similar to mast cells in the tissue
- Release mediators that contribute to inflammation
- Granules contain heparin (anticoagulant), cytokines, 
	and other chemicals involved in allergic and immune responses

Mast Cells
-
- Similar to basophils, but located in tissue
- Release mediators that contribute to inflammation
- Granules contain heparin (anticoagulant), cytokines, 
	and other chemicals involved in allergic and immune responses
- Concentrated in connective tissues of skin, lungs, and GI tract.
	- ideal for intercepting pathogens that are:
		1. Inhaled
		2. Ingested
		3. Entering through a break in the epidermis

Neutrophils
-
Phagocytic cells that kill 5-20 bacteria in their lifetime
Usually live 1-2 days
Most abundant white blood cells (50-70%)
Identified by a segmented nucleus of 3-5 lobes connected by thin strands of nuclear material
Immature neutrophils have horseshoe-shaped nuclei
formed in bone marrow and released into circulation. 
Most remain in blood, only exit if attracted to damage or infection site
Also release cytokines:
	1. Pyrogens (fever inducers)
	2. Inflammatory response mediators

Eosinophils
-
Bright pink staining granules in cytoplasm
Associated with allergic reactions and parasitic diseases
Rare in bloodstream, only 1-3% of all leukocytes
Life span of 6-12 hours
Concentrated in digestive tract, lungs, urinary and genital epithelia, and connective tissue.
	- Defense against parasitic invaders
	- Attaches to antibody-coated parasites like blood fluke and kill it
Contribute to allergic reactions as well
	- inflammation and tissue damage
	- toxic enzymes, oxidative substances, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin.
Also phagocyte, but we don't know how the importance of that role in the body right now.

Monocytes/Macrophages
-
Monocytes are the precursors to macrophages
Monocytes aren't common in blood (1-6%)
	Really, they just travel from bone marrow to tissue destination (~8 hours in bloodstream)
Once arriving at tissue, they enlarge and differentiate into macrophages
	1. Can creep along the tissue in an amoeboid motion
	2. Also can stay fixed in one location
Act as primary scavengers of the tissue. Ingest ~100 bacteria in lifetime
Also remove old red blood cells and dead neutrophils
Also help in acquired immune system by presenting antigens of ingested bacteria
Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) -- these are PRRs that trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines

Lymphocytes
-
Mediate the acquired immune system
Body can contain about a trillion lymphocytes at any one time
Most highly concentrated in lymphoid tissue, also 20-35% of all circulating white blood cells
B lymphocytes
	- antibody production and antigen presentation
T lymphocytes
	- defense against intracellular pathogens such as viruses

Dentritic Cells
-
Antigen-presenting cells characterized by long, thin processes
Found in skin and other organs
Once they capture antigens, they migrate to secondary lymphoid tissue and present antigens to lymphocytes.

Nonspecific Immune Responses
==

Physical Barriers
-
First line of nonspecific defense: physical barriers
	- skin
	- mucous lining of GI tract
	- ciliated epithelium of respiratory tract
Digestive and respiratory systems are most vulnerable to microbial invasion
Any pathogens that get past these physical barriers are first confronted with the innate immune response

Recognition Process
-
Key: Recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by binding 
		to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)

1. Patrolling and stationary phagocytes attracted to areas of invasion by chemotaxins (act as PAMPs)
2. Once they start fighting, leukocytes release their own chemotaxic cytokines to recruit more leukocytes.
3. If this is happening in tissue, lots of phagocytes leave the blood and converge at place of infection.
	If there's a lot of phagocytes, pus forms (collection of living and dead neutrophils and macrophages,
		along with tissue fluid, cell debris, and other remnants of the immune process)

Phagocytes eat a lot; almost any organic or inorganic compound. Injest foreign particles by 
	endocytosis and then fuse the phagosome with lysosomes, breaking down the invader.
Some bacteria have developed masked membranes that aren't immediately flagged by phagocytes. 
	Once detected, they are coated with antibodies to flag down the phagocytes to consume them.
	Tagging compounds (like the antibodies and other plasma proteins) are called opsonins.

Natural Killer Cells
-
One of the only lymphocytes that are a part of the innate response
Specifically used against viral infections by recognizing infected cells and triggering apoptosis
Secrete interferons
	IFN-alpha and IFN-beta targe host cells and promote synthesis of antiviral proteins to prevent viral 
		replication.
	IFN-gamma activates macrophages and other immune cells

Inflammation
-
A hallmark of the innate immune system.
Three important roles:
	1. Attracts immune cells and chemical mediators to the site
	2. Produces a physical barrier to slow the spread of infection
	3. Promotes tissue repair once the infection is under control (not part of the immune system)
Key Compounds in inflammatory response:
	- Acute phase proteins
		produced by the liver; general name, includes opsonins, antiprotease molecules, and CRP
		Can be linked to chronic inflammatory disease if the levels of CRP don't drop
		Also some links to coronary heart disease, but not deterministic
	- Histamine
		Found in the granules of mast cells and basophils
		Helps initiate the inflammatory response when mast cells degranulate
		Brings more leukocytes to injury site
		Opens pores in capillaries and causes vasodilation, inducing edema
			hot, red, swollen area around wound or infection
		Can trigger the stuffy nose characteristic of allergies
		One contributor of anaphylactic shock
	- Interleukins
		Cytokines that mediate communication among different types of leukocytes and also other
			parts of the body
		IL-1 secreted by activated macrophages and other immune cells. Mediates the inflammatory response
			and has other systemic effects:
				- Altering blood vessel endothelium
				- Stimulating production of acute-phase proteins
				- Inducing fever
				- Stimulating cytokine and endocrine secretion
	- Bradykinin
		end product of the kinin cascade (similar to coagulation cascade)
		same vasodilator effect as histamine
		stimulates pain receptors, giving injuries their tenderness
	- Complement proteins
		Complement = a group of more than 25 plasma proteins and cell membrane proteins
		Complement cascade is similar to blood coagulation cascade
			intermediates of the cascade serve as opsonins, chemical attractants for leukocytes,
				and agents that trigger mast cell degranulation
		End of the cascade produces membrane attack complexes: 
			group of lipid-soulble proteins that insert themselves into the cell membranes of pathogens
				and virus-infected cells and form giant pores -> lysing pathogens

Acquired Immunity
==
Active immunity: when the body is exposed to a pathogen and produces its own antibodies
Passive immunity: when antibodies are acquired from another organism (i.e. mother to fetus)
	these only last about three months until the antibodies are cleared from the bloodstream
