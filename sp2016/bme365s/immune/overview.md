Immunology
-
Def: A science that deals with the way in which the body protects itself from diseases and infections
System is extremely complex; we're taking a very slow dive in so we can get the details
Core immunology message: "Kill the pathogen, don't harm the host"
Key features:
	- Specificity and Memory (distinguish self from non-self)
Three Major Functions:
	1. Protect body from disease-causing invaders
		pathogens and antigens
	2. Remove dead cells or damaged tissues and cells
		inflammed cells, old blood cells
	3. Recognition and removal of abnormal "self" cells
		cancer cells
Steps of the Immune Response
	1. Detect and identify (or recognize) foreign substances
	2. Communicate between immune cells
	3. Recruit assistance and coordination
	4. Destruction or suppression of the invader
Battle Analogy:
	1. Recognize: who is the enemy?
	2. Tactics: how to fight and kill?
	3. Troops: who will fight?
	4. Advance: where to fight?
	5. Supply: what provisions are required
	6. Reinforcement: how to recruit?
	7. Rebel hunting: who is friend or foe?
	8. Communication: when, go or don't go
	9. Cease-fire: why stop, how to clean up

Immune System Failures:
	- Incorrect response
		Autoimmune disease, like type 1 diabetes
	- Overactive response
		Allergies
	- Lack of response
		Immunodeficiency diseases
		AIDS

Types of Pathogens
	1. Bacteria
		cells with membrane and cell wall
		can survive outside of host and reproduce w/o host
		can be killed or inhibited by antibiotics
		Gram negative
			- Two membranes, smaller peptidoglycan (10%)
		Gram Positive
			50-90% peptidoglycan, one inner membrane
	2. Virus
		Nucleic core
		invade, take over, more virus is released
		Difficult to study b/c we can't grow them in vitro in the laboratory

Lines of defense
	1. Nonspecific (mechanical, chemical, reflexes)
	2. Nonspecific (fever, phagocytosis, inflammation, NK cells, Leukocytes)
	3. Specific (adaptive): (cell-mediated (T-cells) and humoral (B-cells))

White blood cells (leukocytes)
	Drived from bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells
	Have nuclei (RBCs don't)
	Blood samples: Ficoll solution is a sticky saccharide solution, gives a density gradient for centrifugation

How do we distinguish self vs. non-self?
	In the bone marrow: B-cell
	recognizes a whole lotta different antibodies, randomly
	Once a b-cell finds a specific binding event, it is killed by the immune system
		acts as a training period for the immune system
		b-cells that don't bind to anything are eventually released into the blood stream
Lymphoid Tissue
	1. Primary: Thymus Gland (T-cells) and bone marrow (b-cells)
	role: get cells form and mature
	naive immune cells: mature but unspecialized
	Cells involved in the immune response form and mature
	2. Secondary: lymph nodes and spleen
	role: get mature immune cells to interact with pathogens and initiate a response
	tissues are divided into encasulated and unencapsulated diffuse lymphoid tissues

Lymph System
	***All flow is from branches to nodes***
	Unique feature of lymph system
	Interface btwn lymphatic system and blood vessels occurs at thoracic duct

Spleen 
	Largest lymphoid organ in the body
	immunce cells in the spleen monitor the blood for foreign invaders
	phagocytes in the spleen trap and remove pathogens

Encapsulated lymphoid tissue (spleen and lymph nodes) vs. Diffuse lymphoid tissue (aggregates of immune cells)
