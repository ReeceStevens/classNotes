Dr. Jiang's Guest Lecture: Systems Immunology
--
Allergies are not innate; they're linked to your adaptive immune system, and they are highly specific. 

How do we define the critera for a healthy immmune system? 
How many different kinds of antibody does a person have?

Key immune cell questions: who, what, why, and where?

In human biology, the most accessible sample is blood; very few opportunities to take tissue samples
	- mouse systems are very popular
	- Mice have a full immune system, but there's 400 million years separating the mouse immune system from human immune system

New tools for immune profiling
	High throughput repertoire sequencing
	single cell gene expression (very defined set of genes)
	single cell RNA sequencing
	Droplet-based PCR? Sounds pretty cool. 
	single cell affinity test

Receptor diversity in B and T cells:
	VDJ recombination: splicing togethera combintion of V, D, and J gene sections (about a billion or so possible options)
	B cells can undergo somatic hyper mutation to rapidly test changes in the genome coding for the binding receptor
		they basically keep rolling the dice until someone gets a match to the antigen (i.e. a vaccine or infection)
Next gen gene sequencing 
	nanopore: drag DNA through a electriclaly resistive pore, each base will produce a different voltage
	$1000 genome project: allow people to squence their own genome in its entirety for 1000

Repertoire Sequencing Applications
	Development: how much immune system grow vs. increase of diversity
	Aging: 
	Infections: how many mutations, how much abundance of change
	Vaccination: how a repirtoire responds to outside stimulation
	Cancer: monitoring lymphoma relapse after bone marrow transplant
	Autoimmune diseases: convergent evolution, similar receptor sequences found from multiple patients
