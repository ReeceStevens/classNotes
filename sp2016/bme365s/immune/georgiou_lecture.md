Antibody therapy for treatment of cancer
-

Different types of antibodies (progressing to human antibody)
	Murine (found in mice)
	Chimeric (FDA approved antibodies)
	Humanized (everything is human except for the antibody binding cite (CDR))
	Human 

Poeple are focusing on Antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)

Back to Kim's Lecture

Slide 18, know this entire cascade. Kim is saying "take out paper and draw it"
Note: Naive B/T cells are neither effector nor memory cells
NK cells aren't adaptive immunity; they're innate

NK cell self-recognition
	- tolerance: recognizing that a cell has the correct receptors
	- missing self: missing inhibitory receptors -> killed
	- stress-induced self: lots of stress induced ligands on surface -> killed

Blood type changes from when you are a baby (immune development)

Self tolerance
	Lack of immune response by lymphocytes to cells of the body
	Immune system uses clonal deletion to establish tolerance to self
		immature lymphocytes go through a stage where binding of their receptors causes them to die
		process occurs in thymus and bone marrow

Why do we have autoimmune disorders?
Hypotheses:
	1. Self reactive immune cells escape the thymus 
		(may fail b/c of a loack of a particular type of self-antigen)
	2. Autoimmune response may be triggered by pathogens that mimic the structure of self-antigens
Why are females 10x more likely to get autoimmune disease?
	female hormone estrogen promotes production of IFN-gamma
	IFN_gamma activates autoimune response
	Testosterone could have protective theraputic effect in treatment
		would have to block masculanizing side effects

Case study: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We're back.
	Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg)
		powerful suppressor cells that inhibit other self-reactive T cells 
		that recognize antigens on the same tissue
	Th1 and Th17 -> Chrons disease
	Th2 -> something else
