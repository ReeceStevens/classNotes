Phagocytes
-
Dentritic cells are also classified as phagocytes (book got it wrong)
Professional Phagocytes
	- Neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage, dendritic cell, Kupffer cell
Nonprofessional phagocytes
	- lymphocyte, NK cells, epithelium, endothelium, fibroblast

Lymphocytes
-
Responsible for acquired immune response
5% of all lymphocytes are in circulation (20-35% of all circulating white blood cells.)
	Rest located in lymphoid tissue.

Case study: What happens when you get a splinter?
-
- Pathogen makes it past a physical barrier
- Symptoms: red, swollen, hot, pus
	Cause: Innate immune system is kicking into gear
- Macrophages eat bacteria on the splinter
	phagocytosis
	produce chemicals which:
		increase local blood flow (redness, heat)
		increase permeability of blood vessels (swelling)
		recruit other phagocytes to site of infection (pus)

Innate Immune System
-
Primarily effective against pathogens outside of cells
inflammation is hallmark reaction
antiviral defense
two main weapons:
	1. Professional Phagocytes (cells that eat stuff)
	2. The Complement system (cells that tag stuff for destruction)

1. Macrophages
	Patrol periphery
	If they find an invader, they become activated
	if activated, they
		- send signals to recruit other immune cells (neutrophils)
		- become viscious killers
		- present antigen to adaptive immune system
	Activated by:
		Chemataxins (bacterial toxins, cell wall components)
		Tissue Injury Depris (fibrin, collagen fragments)
		Chemotactic cytokines by leukocytes

Phagocytosis Process
-
Pattern recognition receptors
Phagosome fuses with lysosome (pH 5, 50 digestive enzymes, oxidizing agents, N2O2, NO, O2-)
Some pathogens have evolved to have "polysaccharide capsules" that avoid detection by receptors
	Then, phagocytes use antiobody tagging molecues to eat the bacteria
Primary cells: macrophages and neutrophils
Phagocytes reach the pathogen, identify it by chemical cues, and ingest it
If pathogens lack markers, they can be tagged by the tagging proteins (opsonins).

Inflammatory Response
-
Activated tissue macrophages release cytokines
Immune cells attracted to the site release their own cytokines
Released cytokines:
	- attract other immune cells
	- inrease capiallary permeability
	- activate surface molecules of endothelium
	- stimulate cytokine and endocrine secretion
	- cause fever

Interleukin
-
Group of cytokines
Majority of ILs are synthesized by CD4+ Th cell, as well as monocyte, macrophage, epithelium and endothelium
Lymphokine is not an appropriate term for dictating ILs

IL-1
-
Secreted by activated macrophages
Action:
	- alter blood vessel endothelium for easy passage of white blood cells
	- stimulate production of acute phase proteins such as opsonins in the liver
	- induces fever
	- stimulates cytokine secretion

Interferons (IFN alpha and beta)
-
Secreted by virus infected cells to signal to the surrounding cells the presence of a virus
	Make cells more resistant to virus attack by:
		- increase in RNA-degrading enzymes and protein synthesis inhibitors
		- short term effect

Interferon Gamma
-
Secreted by T cells and NK cells
	- inhibits viral replication
	enhances phagocytosis in macrophages
	boost antibody production in B cells
	activated cytotoxic T cells and NK cells

Histamine
-
Is released by mast cells and basophils
initiates the inflammatory response
induce WBC recruitment from blood stream
Action:
- open pores in the capillaries -> release of plasma protein causing local adema or swelling
- dilates blood vessels by increasing blood flow -> bring about hot, red, swollen areas 
	around the wound or infection site

Innate reponse against viral infection
-
Natural Killer cells
Release granzyme (protease)
NK cells induce virus infected cells to commit apoptosis
NK cells secrete antiviral cytokines (interferons)
Interferons interfere with viral reproduction in the body

Complement proteins
-
about 30 plasma and cell membrane proteins
present in tissues and blood
attach to surfaces of bacteria and viruses
	target them for destruction by phagocytes by making pores
	form membrane attack complexes
recruit other immune cells from blood
Produced by the liver cells

Antigen presentation
-
lysosomal enzymes digest pathogen, producting antigenic fragments
antigen-presenting macrophage displayes antigen fragments on surface receptors 
	Antigen-presenting cell (APC)
Process:
	See diagram

Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
	Class I: 
		- All nucleated cells
		- infected cells display viral antigens on MHC 1
		- Cytotocix T cells recognize a cell with foreign antigen fragments and kills the cell
	Class II:
		- Macrophages, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells
		Helper T cells recognize a cell with foreign antigen fragments on the MHC II
		Helper T cells secrete cytokines that enhance the immune response
	
Antigen presentation to Th cells

B and T cells are considered "naive" before they have been trained by antibodies
B cells mature into either
	Effector B cells (plasma cells)
	Memory B cells

Adaptive Immune System
-
Two main componens:
	1. Fight pathogens outside of cells: antibodies
	2. Fight pathogens inside of cells: Killer T cells

Antibodies
-
How are they made?
B cells:
	Lymphocytes that make antibodies
	Have B cell receptors on surface
	100 million different types of B cells, each with different surface receptors
	when B cells bind antigen, 
		B cells activated and idfferentiate into plasma cells
		plasma cells secrete antibodies at a rate of approx 2000 molecules per second
			extremely fast, extremely efficient
Function:
make antigens more visible to the immune system
	Acting as opsonins
	making antigens clump for easier phagocytosis
	inactivating bacterial toxins
enhance inflammation
	activate complement
	activate mast cells
activating immune cells
	antibody-bound antigens activate immune cells
See diagram
