==

Cumulative exam, focus on immune (60-70%)
Most difficult questions will be coming from this section
Includes respiratory system, renal, and digestive

Immune System Content (ch.24 + extra)

Functions and failures
pathogens
anatomy (tissue types cell types and functions)
immune response pathways
antigen-specific responses
advances in immunology (jiang lecture)

Functions and Failures
-
1. Self vs. Non-self
	recognition an removal of abnormal self cells
	failure: autoimmunity (i.e. diabetes type I)
2. Dead or Damaged cells
	proper removal of dead cells
	failure: overreactive; attacks common, non-harmful particulates (allergies)
3. Pathogens
	protects body (i.e. viruses, bacteria, parasites) *** you'll need to know all three of these types of pathogens ***
	failure: immunodeficiency (either primary (genetic) or acquired (HIV->AIDS)

Pathogens
-
See textbook, has lots of good detail

Immune Response
-
Innate Immune System
	- non specific, broad spectrum
	- begins with in minutes to hours
	- produces general imnflammatory response when pathogens penetrate physical barriers
Adaptive Immune Response
	- Adapts to defend against any invader
	- Response to a first expousre to a pathogen can take days
	- important when innate immune system cannot defend against attack
	- provides immune system with "memory"

Anatomy
-
Lymphoid Tissues
	Primary:
		- cells involved in the immune response form and mature
		- Hematopoetic stem cell (bone marrow) and T cell education (thymus)
	Secondary:
		- Encapsulated lypmhoid tissue include spleen and lymph nodes
			spleen: monitors bloood for foreign invaders
			Lyph nodes clusters of immune cells intercept pathogens that have entered interstitialf fluid
		- Diffuse lypmhoid tissue
			aggregations of immune cells that apprea throughout other organ systems of the body
Cells
	***Memorize the table of different immune cells and their functions in the textbook.***
	Morphological and funtional groups
		1. Granulocytes
			White blood cells whose cytoplasm contains prominent granules (mast cells and eosinophils)
		2. Phagocytes
			engluf and ingest their targest (macrophage, dendritic cells)
		3. Cytotoxic cells
			kill the cells they are attacking (T cells, Neutrophils)
		4. Antigen-presenting cells
			display fragments of foreign proteins on their cell surface (dentritic cells, macrophage, sometimes B cells)

Antibodies
-
Part of adaptive immune system
Two main components: 
	Fab region (functional area, pathogen binds here0
	Fc region (where a cell attaches)
	Heavy chains
	Light chains
Two functions:
	Fight pathogens outside of the cell
		Cover the pathogen completely
	Fight pathogens inside of the cell
		help killer T cells to find infected cells
How are they made?
	B cells
		lymphociytes that make antibodies
		have B cell receptors on surface
		100 mill different types of B cells, each with different surface receptors
		B cells receptors are so diverse they can recognize every organic molecule
		VDJ recombination
	When a B cell binds an antigen:
		Activated and differentiate into plasma cells
		Start spewing out huge amounts of antibodies
Functions upon binding to antigen:
	1. Activates B lymphocytes
	2. Acts as opsonins
	3. Causes antigen clumping and inactivation of bacterial toxins
	4. Activates antibody-dependent cellular activity 
	5. Triggers mast cell degranulation (inflammation)
	6. Activates complement (inflammation)

T cells
-
Recognize protein antigens
cell mediated immunity
when bound to an antigen, undergo clonal expansion
two major types:
	1. Killer T cells CD-8 
	2. Helper T cells CD-4
T cells find virus-infected cells
	Cells are always presenting antigens at their surface
	MHC complexes present in all nucleic cells
		major histocompatibility complexes (MHC)
		T cells use thiese proteins as a signal to identify infected cells

Major topics
-
Different types of cells and tissues
how the body response (virus, bacteria, pathogen)
	1. innate immune system
		complement and inflammation
	2. Antibody based immune system
	3. If viral infection, T cells come into play
Time frame of when all of these things happen
	innate is on the order of seconds
	adaptive is on the order of weeks for first exposure, very fast after that
Takes about 6 mos for B,T cell immune system to develop in infancy
	~ 1 month for MHC development
