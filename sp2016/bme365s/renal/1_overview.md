Anatomy overview:
	Kidneys receive 22% of cardiac output but only 0.4% of body weight
	Adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys
	Key anatomical feature is the production of high rate of blood flow through kidneys
	Kidney
		Capsule -- outer 
		Cortex -- outer area of the inner kidney
		Medulla -- inner kidney
		Renal artery and renal vein are adjacent
		Function:
			- Renal Artery: Take in nutrients, electolytes, oxygen, and waste products from the blood
			- Reabsorbed nutrients and reduced O2, but (little to) no waste.
			- Entire blood passes through in ~5 minutes.
			- Filters blood and collects waste products
			- Moves the collected waste into urine
			- helps maintain homeostasis
		2 Capillary beds
			1. Peritubular capillaries (primarily nutrient collection)
			2. Vasa recta (primarily oxygen transfer, around loop of Henle)
	Macroscopic structure:
		Afferent arterioles and glomeruli are all found in the cortex
		Cortex contains all fo the Bowman's capsules, proximal and distal tubules (interface of blood stream to the nephron)
		Medulla contains the loops of Henle and collecting ducts (filtering portion of the nephron)
		Nephron is the basis unit of the kidney, and they are overlapped between the cortex and medulla
		Capillary beds surround the nephron tubes
		Two arterioles:
			- Afferent: going into the nephron
			- Efferent: leaving from the nephron
		Two capillary beds:
			- Glomerulus 
			- Peritubular 
	Nephron structure:
		Glomerulus (ball-like capillary network) --> Bowman's capsule (filtration happens here) --> filtrate --> 
		proximal tube --> descending loop of Henle (lots of salts exiting blood, making medulla salty)
		--> ascending loop of Henle --> distal tube --> collecting duct (up to 8 different nephrons can connect here) --> bladder
	Closer look: Glomerulus
		afferent arteriole -> enters capillary bed --> efferent arteriole
		the Bowman space is empty. 
			blood pressure pushes filtrate out of the blood stream, which collects inside the capsule
		Juxtaglomerular apparatus
			ascending limb of loop of Henle is physically touching the arterioles near the Bowman's capsule
			serves as a feedback loop for maintaining ion concentrations

Six kidney functions:
	1. Regulation of ECF volume
	2. Regulation of osmolarity
		- maintain at 290 mOsM
	3. Maintenance of ion balance
		- Na+ is major ion for the regulation of ECF volume and osmolarity
	4. Homeostatic regulation of pH
		- ECF acidic -> kidney removes h+ and conserves HCO3-
		- ECF alkaline, kidney removes HCO3- and conserves H+
	5. Excretion of wastes and foreign substances
		metabolic wastes such as creatine (from muscle metabolism), urea or uric acidi, urobilinogen (metabolite of hemoglobin)
	6. Production of hormones

Reserve capacity
	A person must lose nearly 3/4 of kidney function before homeostatis begins to be affected
	One kidney is perfectly fine in terms of its homeostatic function (thus, kidney donation is fine)
	
Blood flow
	At any given time, kidney receives 20-25% of cardiac output
	Average of 180L per day through the kidneys
	Average volume of urine leaving the kidney is only 1.5 L per day
		>99% of fluids flowing in nephrons re-enter the bloodstream.
	
Four nephron processes:
	1. Filtration 
		movement from blood to lumen
		happens without specific selection, mostly driven by pressure difference
		Happens in glomerulus and Bowman's capsule
		70% of filtrate is reabsorbed 
		Efficiency:
			180L is filtered per day
			Afferent arteriole: 
				increase in diameter -> higher degree of filtration (higher pressure, more filtrate)
				decrease in diameter -> less filtration
			Efferent arteriole;
				increase in diameter -> less filtration (less pressure inside glomerulus)
				decrease in diameter -> higher filtration (more pressure, more filtrate)
	2. Reabsorption
		from lumen to blood
	3. Secretion
		from blood to lumen
		secretion is selective by using membrane proteins to move particular molecules across tubule epithelium
	4. Excretion
		from lumen to outside the body

Function of different nephron regions
	- Proximal tube: bulk reabsorption of isosmotic (isotonic)fluid
		Reabsorption: Na+, Cl- amino acids, glucose, and water
		There was no chance to transport solutes or solvents, so fluid is still isosmotic
		Secretion: Also transport organic anions (OA-) through the organic anion transporter
	- Loop of Henle: more solute is reabsorbed than water. The primary site for creation of dilute fluid.
		Vasa recta surrounds loop of Henle
		Mostly all reabsorption. 
		H2O passively reabsorbes in descending limb
		Ascending limb has Na+, K+, and Cl- actively transported into the capillary
		Hyposmotic than plasma, and most of the volumen from Bowman's capsule is reabsorbed into capillaries
		~10% of blood flow leaves the loop of Henle
		Osm decreased from 300 to 100 Osm because the net amount of solutes reabsorbed is larger than water
		How do we calculate the osmolarity in the plasma?
			- 4 major solute compounds: Na+, anions (Cl- or HCO3-), glucose, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
			- Na+ = 140 mmol/L = 140 mOsm/L
			- Anions = 140 mOsm/L
			- Glucose = 5 mOsm/L
			- Urea = 5 mOsm/L
			- Sum: 290 mOsM.
				(other minor plasma components like K+, lactate, and other are contribution to the rest of the ~10 mOsM.
				--> really, it's ~300 mOsM in normal plasma
	- Distal tubule and collecting duct: fine regulation of salt and water balance under the control of several hormones
		Reabsorption, secretion, and excretion.
		Fine regulation of salts and water balance takes place under the control of several antidiuretic hormones 
			(aldosterone and vasopressin) in the collecting duct.
		Osmolarity can vary from 50 to 1200 mOsM.
			Can vary to maintain homeostasis in the blood
		In collecting duct, water reabsorption happens because the collecting duct is porous, and the medulla is very salty
			Thus, urine gets even more concentrated
			Final volume for excretion is ~1.5 L.
		Volume:
			Bowman's capsule (180L) -> descending limb (54L) -> ascending (18L) -> bladder (1.5L)
Filtration
	Non-specific, pressure-driven process
	Filtrate composition is like that of plasma minus the plasma proteins
	20% of plasma filters into the nephron
	80% remains in capillaries
	Filtered fluid is composed of water and dissolved solutes
	filtering unit: renal corpuscle
	Podocyte (foot cell): creates pressure on the capillary vessel with its foot processes in order to encourage filtration
		fenestrated capillaries --> very large pores with negatively charged proteins on the pore surface to repel negatively charged plasma proteins
			Pore size: ~15 nm
	How efficient is the renal corpuscle?
		gist: extremely efficient. processes over 180L a day and doesnt' clog.
Podocyte:
	bridged by the slit membrane, the glomerular basement membrane, and the porous capillary endothelium
	Surfaces of the podocytes are covered with a negatively charged glycocalyx
	glomerular basement membrane is composed mainly of collagen, laminin, and the heparan sulfate
	Slit membrane is a porous membrane composed of nephrin, P-cadherin, and FAT1. Joined to the cytoskeleton by various adapter proteins.	

Three filtration barriers in renal corpuscle
	1. Glomerular capillary endothelium
	2. The basal lamina (basement membrane)
		Like a coarse sieve; made of negatively charged glycoprotieins and collagen-like material
	3. Epithelium of Bowman's capsule
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) *MUST REMEMBER THIS PARAMETER*
	Definition: amount of fluid that filters into the Bowman's capsule per unit time
	180 L/day for a health human
	blood volume is usually 5.4 L per 70 kg
	plasma is ~58% of blood, so ~3.1 L per 70 kg
	--> kidneys filter the entire plasma 60 times per day (2.5 times per hour)
