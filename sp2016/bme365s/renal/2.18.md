Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR, from last time) *Remember this!*
    Def. the amount of fluid that filters into Bowman's capsule per unit time
    average: 180 L/day
    Estimating GFR

Net filtration pressure determines GFR
    backpressure 30 mmHg + 15 mmHg from fluid
    blood pressure ~ 55 mmHg
    => net filtration pressure is 10 mmHg into the bowman's capsule

Filtration Coefficients determining GFR:
    1. Surface area of glomerular capillaries
        - decreaseed surface area -> decreased GFR
        - Chronic pyelonephritis (inflammation of the kidney, caused by bacterial infection through unrinary tract)
    2. Permeability of capillary-Bowman's capsule interface
        - increase in permeability -> increased GFR
        - Permeability normally limits molecules larger than 50 kDa
        - Plasma proteins that are saved in the blood stream include albumin (70 kDa), globulin (165 kDa), fibrinogen (200 kDa), and hemoglobin (68 kDa).

GFR is relatively constant for most range of blood pressures
    constant for ~(80-180 mmHg)
    maintained by autoregulation
    
Filtration efficiency in glomerulus
    When afferent arterioles dilate, filtration increases; efferent arterioles dilate, filtration decreases. (turning on inlet vs. outlet)

Juxtaglomerular apparatus
    - the ascending loop of henle that is touching the afferent and efferent arterioles
    - The cells lining this boundary are specialized cell types: *macula densa cells*
        - release paracrine signals to induce the afferent arteriole constrictions
    - Cells around the afferent arterioles (normal) are called granular cells (secrete renin, an enzyme involved in salt and water balance) (a.k.a. juxtaglomerular cell)
    - Provides tubuloglomerular feedback for GFR autoregulation
    GFR increase -> flow through tubule increases -> flow by macula densa increases -> paracrine from macula densa to afferent arteriole
    -> afferent arteriole constricts -> resistance in afferent arteriole increases -> hydrostatic pressure in glomerulus decreases -> GFR decreases

Macula Densa vs. Granular cells
-
Macula Densa Major Roles
    1. Sensing NaCl level
    2. Releasing paracrine signals (ATP, adenosine, nitric oxide) to afferent arteriole
    3. Stimulate juxtaglomerular cells to secrete renin
Granular cell major roles
    1. Synthesize, store, and secrete renin
    2. Key modulator of Renin-angiotensin system
    3. Autoregulation of the kidney
Work together to maintain homeostasis via sodium concentrations!

Detailed Mechanism: MD cells
    MD uptake NaCL via Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the apical membrane of MD
    Concentration of Na+ increases in the cytoplasm (therefore, basolateral side of MD there is no sufficient Na+/K+/ATPase)
    cell osmolarity increases
    cell swelling (water moves into cytoplasm)
    basolateral anion channels open
    ATP is released
    ATP degrades into adenosin
    adenosin is secreted into the ECF, triggers granular cells to constrict afferent arteriole
Detailed Mechanism: Granular cells
    NaCl drops
    MD cells secrete prostaglandins to JG cells
    JG cells dsecrete renin into blood stream
        renin hydrolyze circulating angiotensinogen (produced and secreted by liver)
        As a result, angiotensin I (ANG I; an oligopeptide hormone) is produced.
        Angiotensin converteing enzyme (ACE) converts ANGI to ANGII in lungs
        ANG II acts on adrenal glands to produce aldosterone (a steriod hormone)
            release aldosterone -> na+ reabsorption -> increased blood pressure
            stimulate vascular smooth muscle cells -> arteriolar vasoconstriction -> increased blood pressure
    blood pressure increases

Reabsorption
-
Most reabsorption takes place in the proximal tubule (70%)
Why do we filter 180 L/day and reabsorb 99% of it? why not just filter and excrete only 1%?
    1. Once something is filtered, it's external to the body environment so the filtrate is destined to leave the body as urine
    2. Filtering ions and water in to the tubule simpilfies their regulation. If your body doesn't need to reabsorb, it won't do it based upon the regulation for the homeostasis.
Transepithelial transport

Filtrate has the same colute concentrations as ECF. How do we generate a concentration or electrochemical gradient for transport?
    polarized cells of transporing epithelia
        2 pathways: paracellular (between cells)
                    transcellular (through the cell)
    Na+ is actively transported!
    Anions (passive, by electrochemical gradient)
    H20 (passive, osmosis)
    K+, Ca2+, urea (passive, by diffusion)

Sodium Readsorption
    can be either active or passive
    Transported by the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC)
    Na in the filtrate can enter tubular epithelim passively due to electrochemical gradient
    intracellular Na_ is actively transported out across the Na+-K+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane

Glucose reabsorption: Symport
    moves two or more compounds in the same direction (basically piggybacks off of Na+) for absorption
    passive movement into the cell on the apical membrane (diffision)
    GLUT transporter (passive) moves the glucose through the basolateral membrane

Carrier mediated transport
    - Uniport
    - Symport -- glucose symport with sodium
        Glucose
        Amino acids
        ions (phosphate, sulfate)
        organic metabolites (lactate, TCA cycle intermediates, etc.)
    - Antiport

Urea reabsorption
    Nitrogenious waste products have no active transporters in the proximal tubule
        --> Diffusion!   
    Concentrations in the filtrate and ECF are equal. How is it reabsorbed?
        1. Na+ and other solutes are reaaborbed from the proximal tubule
        2. Osmotic gradient induces water transport across epithelium
        3. after water reabsoprtion, the concentration of urea in the lumen increases
        4. Concentration gradient allows urea move out of the lumen into ECF

Transport mediated by membrane proteins
    - Saturation: the maximum rate of transport that occurs when all available carriers are occupied with substrate
        TRansport maximum: T_m = the transport rate at saturation
    - Specificity 
    - Competition
Filtration doesn't exhibit saturation 
Glucose reabsorption rate: does exhibit saturation

Excretion = filtration - reabsorption
    note: virtually no glucose is secreted out of the body in the healthy state 
        presence of glucose in urine is sign of disease state like diabetes
    No glucose is excreted until the renal threshold is reached (~300 mg/mL)

Transfer fro the interstitial fluid into the capillary
    the key- low hydrostatic pressure along the entire length of peritubular capillaries, which favors reabsoprtion
    capillaries have hydrostatic pressure of 10 mmHg

Secretion 
-
Transfer of molecules from ECF into lumen of nephron
    depends on membrane transport system
    Active process that requries moving substrates against concentration gradients
    secreted substances include:
        organic anions, K+, H+, NH4+, xenobiotics (i.e. drug compounds)

Excretion
-
process by which waste products are eliminated
over reabsorption, organic wastes are concentrated
FDA requires info about how the human kidney handles each new drug
*Clearance*: pharmacokinetic measurement of the volume of plasma that is completely cleared off a substance per unit time
    Clearance of "X" (mL/min) = excretion rate of "X" (mg/min) / plasma concentration (mg/mL)
    for a substance with 100%, GFR = clearance.
    example: Inulin clearance ( a polysaccharide isolated from dahlia plants)
        neither reabsorbed nor secreted -> 100% of inulin that filters into the tubule is excreted
    Filtered load of X = [X] in plasma * GFR
        for inulin, "filtered load of inulin = excretion rate of inulin"
    See Table 19.1 for these equations
    alternatively, creatinine can used since it is already produced in the body
Physiological importance of clearance
    "how can we measure GFR in a living human by taking only blood and urine samples?"
    Once you know the GFR, you can find the compound's plasma concentration and excretion rate to determine kidney behavior with respect to the compound
    high medullary interstitial osmolarity allows urine to be concentrated
