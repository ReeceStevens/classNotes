The 6 kidney functions
Functional nephron regions
	proximal tubule: bulk reabsorption of isosmotic fluid (not regulated)
	loop of henle: more solute reabsorbed than water
	distal tubule

Microenvironment of glomerulus
GFR:
	amount of fluid that filters into Bowman's capsule per unit time
	determined by net filtration pressure
	Tubuloglomerular feedback for GFR regulation
		know the mechanisms for how this works (both directions)

Juxtaglomerular apparatus
	bowman's capsule, granular cells, macula densa cells, glomerulus

Focus on quantitative questions (i.e. diffusion concentrations, osmolarity, GFR, clearance)
	Inulin is a good compound because it is completely cleared from the body
		-> clearance rate = GFR

Kidneys can only conserve volume, not increase it.
	Urine concentration controlled in distal tubule and collecting duct
	renal medulla has very high osmolarity (very salty)
