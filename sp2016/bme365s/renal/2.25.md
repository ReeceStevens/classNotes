Outline:
	- Sodium Balance
	- Potassium balance
	- Acid-base balance

Sodium Balance
-
Function of aldosterone
	Output
	- number of Na+, k+ channels increase
	- [Na+] increase
	- Water (volume) increase
	- [K+] decrease 
	- Osmolarity about equal
	Input
	- potassium, blood pressure, Na+, ANG II

Renin-angiogensin System (RAS)
	Blood pressure increasing system
	Renin controlled by a variety of factors, results in a downstream increase in blood pressure
	ANG II -> synthesis and release of aldosterone in adrenal cortex

Potassium Regulation
-
Most K+ is inside cells, only about 2% in ECF
Normal range: 3.5 - 5 mM
Pathological range is < 3 or > 6
	Muscles and nerves in excitable tissues will show altered function in a pathological case
Abnormality of K+ balance
	- Hypokalemia: plasma concentration is low
		causes muscle weakness b/c it is more difficult to hyperpolarize neurons and muscles
		danger: failure of respiratory muscles and the heart
	- Hyperkalemia: excessive plasma K+
		depolarization of excitable tissue makes them more excitable initiallly
		-> cells unable to repolarize fully and become less excitable
		Danger: life threatening cardiac arrhythmias

Integrated Control of Volume and Osmolarity
-
See the slide with the 3x3 grid on osmolarity vs. water volume change and body response
There are two opposing signals for dehydration response:
	- Secrete aldosterone (decrease in blood pressure, triggered by RAS pathway)
	- Don't secrete aldosterone (increase in osmolarity, inhibits aldosterone secretion
	*Rule of thumb: Restore osmolarity first, then restore volume.*

pH in the Body
-
Outside of the body's internal environment (i.e. lumen of GI or renal tract) can have its own pH
	stomach: can be as low as 1
	Urine: varies btwn 4.5 and 8.5
	Internal enviornment: 7.38-7.42
Pathology:
	Acidosis: low pH
		- CNS depression, neurons less excitable
	Alkalosis: high pH
		- neurons become hyperexcitable
		- sensory changes (numbness, tingling, muscle twitches
		- severe alkalosis -> paralyze respiratory msucle functions
pH in the body is buffered by bicarbonate buffer
	Carbonic anydrase (CA) is the key enzyme here
H+ created by CO2 in a day?
	CO2 from resting metabolism produces 12500 mEq/day
		in 3L per day, -> 4167 mEq/L. Huge difference from body's resting concentration of 0.00004 mEq/L.
		-> pH homeostasis
3 Major homeostatic processes
	1. Buffers: first line of defense
	2. Ventilation: rapid response, takes care of ~75% of pH disturbances
	3. Renal regulation: relatively slow response that deals with remaining pH disturbances

Buffer systems:
	Intracellular:
		- Cellular proteins
		- phosophate ions
		- hemoglobin
	Extracellular:
		- Plasma bicarbonate concentration (24mEq/L, much higher than [H+])
		- intracellular buffereing of H+ is carried out by HCO2- produced by the carbonic anhydrase in the Hb
Physiological imporatnce
	- elevated PCO2 (hypercapnia -> acidosis -> protein denaturation
	- blood PCO2 increase -> H+ in plasma -> respiratory acidosis
Changes in [H+] are much more significant than changes is [HCO3-] because of how significantly more concentrated bicarbonate is.
Respiratory Compensation
	- Hypoventilation: high CO2, respiratory rate needs to increase
	- Hyperventilation: low CO2, respiratory rate needs to slow down
	Stimuli: H+ and CO2
		- H+ -> peripheral carotid and aortic chemoreceptors
		- CO2 -> central chemoreceptors of medulla oblongota
pH Homeostasis in Kidneys
	take care of 25% of compensation that lungs can't handle
	slower than lungs (effective window 24-48 hours)
	Note: no apical membrane transporter for HCO3-
		Bicarbonate can be maintained or transported into the bloodstream, but protons are what is pumped into the lumen
	Membrane transporters (you have to know them for the test)
		1. Na+-H+ antiport (NHE): apical side.
		2. Na+-HCO3- symport (basolateral side)	
		3. Na+-NH4+ antiport (apical side)
		4. H+-ATPase (apical side)
		5. H+-K+-ATPase (apical side)
		6. H+-ATPase (basolateral side)
		7. H+-K+-ATPase (basolateral side)
Respiratory Acidosis
	CO2 retention and elevated plasma PCO2
	cause: alveolar hypoventilation
	hallmark: decreased pH and elevated HCO3-
	Compensation: renal excretion of H+ and reaborbtion of HCO3-

Metabolic Acidosis
	caused by dietary and metabolic input of acid exceeds acid excretion
	decrease in HCO3-
	respiratory compensation: hyperentialtion
	renal compensation

respiratory alkalosis	
metabolic alkalosis
