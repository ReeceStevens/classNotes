BME 365S Lecture -- 2.2.16
==
MIDTERM 1 is coming up!!!! Feb 11th
	1 hour long, BUR 108
	Previous exams are on canvas in "practice exam" folder
	Study questions at the end of each chapter
	Grading will take a few weeks 

Outline for today:
	- Gas transport in the blood
	- regulation of ventilation

Oxygen Transport in the Blood
-
Oxygen is dissolved into the bloodstream
	2% is dissolved into plasma
	98% bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells

Hemoglobin 
	Hb + (1-4) O2 <--> Hb(O2)_{1-4} (oxyhemoglobin = HbO2)
	Only dissolved O2 can be utilized in the body
	Amount of O2 carried by Hb depends on:
		- Po2
		- pH
		- Temperature

Law of Mass Action
	- Le Chatelier's Principle
	- Reversible Reactions
		Keq = [C][D]/([A][B])
	When a reaction is at equilibrium, the ratio of products and substrates will remain constant.

Oxygen consumption at rest is about 250 mL; if no Hb, only 3 mL dissolved oxygen per 1L blood.
	end result: 250 mL O2 per minute vs. 15 mL O2 per minute. 

Hemoglobin increases O2 transport
	- Low partial pressure of oxygen -> low concentration of oxygen in red blood cells
Amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin depends on:
	- Plasma O2 --> %saturation of Hb
	- Amount of hemoglobin --> number of Hb binding sites

Arterial partial pressure of oxygen depends on:
	- the air you breathe in 
	- alveolar ventilation rate
	- efficiency of gas exchange from alveoi to blood

Blood substitutes
	- perfluorodecalin
		Lots of fluorines on the outside of a double-ring structure
	- motivation for blood substitutes:
		- blood shortages
		- wounded soldiers
		- infected blood supplies
		- loss of nitric oxide in donated blood

Saturation Curve
	100% oxgenated blood -> saturated
	if half of the binding sites are open, 50% saturated
	at the alveoli, Po2 = 100 mmHg
	*Know the physiological meaning of the oxygen-hemoglobin saturation curve*
	alveoli are at the high end of the spectrum
	Resting cells are about 40 mmHg, or 75-80% saturation
	exercising cells can drop to 20 mmHg (~35% saturation)
	The sigmoidal shape of the curve maximizes efficiency of gas exchange in the cells that require it most.
		- faster saturation and dissociation of O2 at low Po2 levels
	- at rest, only 1/4 of Hb is used.
	- The other 3/4 of HbO2 exists as a built-in reservoir for increased metabolism
	In theory, 100% Hb saturation at 650 mmHg Po2
	
Factors affecting O2-Hb binding
-
Any factor that changes the conformation of Hb affects its ability to bind to O2
 - Plasma pH, PCO2, Temperature
 - Sigmoidal shape of dissociation curve

Bohr Effect (Not Neils, his dad)
	Hemoglobin's o2 binding affinity is inversely related both to acidity and to the concentration of CO2
	CO2 + H2O <-> H2CO3 <-> H+ + HCO3- 		(carbonic anydrase)
		important concept: increase in CO2 -> increase in protons, decrease in pH -> affinity for Hb to O2 decreases -> O2 is released
	increasing PCO2 shifts dissociation curve to right (more CO2 -> more need for O2)
	decreasing pH shifts dissociation curve to right (lactic acid and CO2 increase -> lower pH)
	increasing temperature shifts dissociation curve to right (exercising cells warm up, indicate more O2 needed)
	increasing metabolic compound (2,3-DPG) shifts dissociation curve to the right (more metabolism -> more O2 required)
		generated during hypoxia conditions in RBCs. Ordinary level is 5 mmol/L.
		in chronic hypoxia condition, increase in this compound which binds to deoxyhemoglobin and alters its structure.
			This altered deoxyhemoglobin has low oxygen affinity, decreasing saturation.
	Maternal vs. Fetal hemoglobin
		- fetal hemoglobin grabs up oxygen much more readily (almost 2x) than maternal hemoglobin in order to pull oxygen from mother's blood
			- has two gamma protein chains which enhance the binding of O2 even in the low O2 environment of the placenta

CO2 Transport in the Blood
Dissolved CO2 in plasma (7%), HCO3- in plasma (70%), HbCO2 (23%)
Elevated PCO2 -> hypercapnia -> pH decrease (acidosis) -> protein denaturation
	Blod PCO2 increase -> respiratory acidosis
	High PCO2 can depress CNS function, causing confusion, coma, and death

Ventilation Control
-
A contemporary model: control of ventilation
	- respiratory neurons in the medulla control inspiration and expiration
	- Neurons in teh pnos modulate ventilation
	- the rhythmic pattern of breathing comes from a network of spontaneously discharging neurons
	- Ventilation is modulated by CO2, O2, and H+
	- STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. Not an entire picture.
Two nuclei in the medulla oblogata
	Ventral respiratory group (VRG) (number 2 on chart) (expiration)
	Dorsal respiratory group (DRG) (number 14 on chart) (inspiration)
Central pattern generator
	- functions automatically throughout a person's life
	- can be controlled voluntarily
	- creates the rhythmic cycles of inpsirtation and expiration
	- is modulated by sensory input from receptors for CO2, O2, and H+
Neural activity
	During inspiration, positive feedback loop for neurons
	During expiration, no feedback loop (fairly quiet)
	Feedback loop begins again for next inspiration

Chemioreceptors
	CO2
	Oxygen
	pH
	Peripheral chemioreceptors
		aortic wall and carotid
		only responds to dramatic changes of arterial Po2 (i.e. high altitude, COPD)
	Central chemioreceptors
		in medulla, close to neurons involved in respiratory control
		monitors CSF pH
