Lecture 10.20.14
----------------

Math Library
	Inherent imprecision in math library
	example:
		y = Math.sqrt(4.0)
		x = 2.0
		(x == y) may not equal true!!!
	
		delta = 1.0e-18
		abs(x-y) < delta
		
	Math.ceil(num)
	Math.hypot(x, y) -- returns distance between x and y
	Math.floor
	Math.sqrt

Strings
	Negative indexing
	Going backwards, the last character is -1 and the first character is -(len(string))
