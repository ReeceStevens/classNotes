Announcements
	1. Exam 1 will be returned Wednesday
	2. Lab 4 due-- clarifications
	3. Lab 5 is in C!!! :D :D :D
		will be using structs
	4. HW 4 is now online, covers arrays in C

Lab 4
	Functional Debugging
		Save debugging information into arrays ("Data" and "Time")
		Minimally intrusive debugging
		Declaring arrays in C	
			uint32_t DataBuffer[size];
			uint32_t TimeBuffer[size];
		Using pointers to access elements in the array

	SysTick	
		NVIC_ST_CTRL_R->last three bits: ClockSource, InterruptEnable, ENable
			setting these bits to 101 -> clocksource plus PLL, switch to 80MHz
		NVIC_ST_RELOAD_R-> The initial value of the timer
		NVIC_ST_CURRENT_R-> The current time of systick
		Systick runs in parallel with processor, i.e. it takes no processor time-- we can access it whenever we want
	 
	Texas_Init
		- Contains the grader
		- Voltmeter on PD4 (might be PD3) (use Texas Display)-- connect PD4 with any other pin and it will serve as a voltmeter
		
	Note about AAPCS
		Must push/pop an even number of registers!
		If not, will throw the "not preserving 8 bit alignment" error
