Programming Assignments
-----------------------

first assignment is pretty large, and it's due two weeks from now

Office Hours:

Office: POB 3.442

Project 1: no new knowledge required
	use it as a gauge for how much you need to invest in the course

Must change password to SVN user before submitting assignments
default password: ee312sp2015

Visual Studio instructions:
	create new empty project, add .c source files
	running the built project is in the DEBUG-menu
	Once you confirm the largest number, update the comments in the header of the file

	floating point weirdness: precision is like scientific notation. eventually it rounds and 
	no longer increments the same way

	float has 24 bits of precision (7 digits)
	problem: 0.1 cannot be exactly represented in binary, so floating point won't work as expected
	(don't fix the program, just write that it's not exactly equal in the comments
